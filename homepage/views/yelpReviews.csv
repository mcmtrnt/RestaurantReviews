Wallabys,Chick fil A,Cheesecake Factory
"It was very good! Ordering was fast and easy and they got food out to us quickly. They had social distancing and wore masks and hand sanitizer was available. The meat was nice and tender, the fries and potatoes were top notch. Well done!","You really can\u0026#39;t go wrong with Chick-fil-A. No one does COVID precautions or runs a drive through better than they do! They had fans, wore bucket hats, and said \u0026#34;my pleasure\u0026#34; like nobody\u0026#39;s business. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI would like to make a public service announcement that you MUST get a cookies n cream shake at some point in your life. It was absolutely PHENOMENAL. The fries are always hot, the chicken is always tasteful... \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNeed I say more? The only drawback is the mess of a parking lot that this Chick-fil-A finds itself in. They make the best of sharing a lot with Sonic, mini Target, Cubby\u0026#39;s, etc.","Our food was really great as always when we come. \u00a0Our waiter Steven H \u00a0did a fab job! \u00a0Kept us informed and provided \u00a0great service! Good atmosphere despite covid, they did a great job making us feel safe. \u003cbr\u003eLittle tip: After you check in, they request that you wait outside. Plan ahead if it\u0026#39;s cold or raining. \u00a0My only complaint was the music playing was a little too loud and the hostess was a little uptight."
"Best bbq n sides in town! Love the sweet habanero pulled pork, brisket, and lemon chicken with Mac n cheese and side salad \u00a0Excellent curbside service. Order got a little mixed up and they generously made up for it. Greatly appreciate that!","The people at this Chick-fil-A are awesome. It\u0026#39;s raining outside and they are wearing portable tents along with the masks. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThey were still so polite and efficient! We\u0026#39;re in this together, thanks for being so amazing!","Our food was really great as always when we come. \u00a0Our waiter Steven H \u00a0did a fabulous job! \u00a0Kept us informed and provided \u00a0great service!

Best bbq/smokehouse food in town! We love the beef brisket platter. I got the sweet salad on the side this time and loved it! Staff is very friendly as well.,"Typically I would give any Chick-Fil-A a 10/5 for their awesome customer service (and these guys do great with their customer service), but I have had a minor incident happen twice here. I\u0026#39;m not sure if there\u0026#39;s been a moth in my fries or have been served a batch of fries with dirt/rot in it, but it\u0026#39;s happened twice where I\u0026#39;ll bite into my fries without looking and something tastes really, really bad. If they could look into this and make sure the fries they serve aren\u0026#39;t dirty or contaminated, I would give them 10 stars out of 5! (I just want to be able to trust these guys every time i go and not have to examine every single fry before i eat it. Maybe i should anyway). Everything else has been wonderful though!","Love the food, service and especially the lemon drop martinis! \u00a0They were doing everything right to provide social distancing and made it a safe dining atmosphere."
We enjoy wallaby\u0026#39;s a lot. They have good food and great service. Their staff is always friendly. Their food is always cooked perfect and brought to your table after you order and always hot. We have beaver had a single complaint. \u003cbr\u003eWe love their pulled pork and Mac and cheese. Then you add in some of their sauce and it\u0026#39;s perfect!,"Nothing is better than chick fil a. No better service, no better food. I\u0026#39;d eat here ever meal if my wallet and pants allow it",All was well except for when I put on their special request: \u00a0celebrating my son\u0026#39;s birthday and baby with a stroller.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou got the note about the stroller but disregard birthday celebration. \u00a0Lol why even ask the customer when you don\u0026#39;t do anything special??\u003cbr\u003eWe still tipped our waiter good and bought cheesecake on the way out. \u00a0 Still loved the food just missed on the cues. \u00a0Could at least greet with a Happy Birthday? Oh well
"First off check in when you get there, they have a treat for you!! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis place was so good!! All the food was spot on! We came with a good size group and it was nice to find seating for us all together not crowded.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are many choices so I will be back to try more, but the ribs are definitely going to be a choice again!! Yummy! Also I got a side of ranch for my veggies and they were to die for!!","I like this location and the food. The only problem I see is that it gets extremely crowded around lunch time. You may end up waiting in the drive through for a good half hour. It\u0026#39;s probably worse now during covid, or maybe not since there might be less people working and therefore getting lunch around this location. Great fries, sandwiches, and diet lemonade, as usual!","Weeks and weeks ago, I was feeling incredibly famished from a day of heavy lifting and strenuous activities, I decided that it was time to quench my hunger. I said to myself \u0026#34;Maybe it\u0026#39;s time for The Cheesecake Factory\u0026#34; and went on the website to place an order. Here\u0026#39;s where I made an AWFUL mistake, I ordered the Avocado Egg Roll and burger sliders. I began my journey to 6223 S State St, Murray, UT 84107. I arrived and I got a text asking me what car and make and model I had, I tell them a hilarious funny joke over text and tell them my car\u0026#39;s make and model, my joke is ignored as I get no reply. A worker knocks on my car\u0026#39;s glass and doesn\u0026#39;t even say \u0026#34;Hello how are you Sir!!!!\u0026#34;. They still greeted me so it\u0026#39;s fine, this is really just personal preference \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI arrive home and begin to ear my meal, I immediately feel full of sorrow and pain snd disgust. The Egg Rolls were mediocore and the sliders were that of burger king quality, which to me is below McDonalds. I wouldn\u0026#39;t recommend these dishes but the bread that comes along with the food is great and the fries were good too!"
"We loved Wallaby\u0026#39;s. I like that they have a tri-tip steak option. It was well-cooked too, nice and soft. The brisket was also a good amount of fatty too so I liked it a lot. The paper jack mac is great if you\u0026#39;re into a good kick. The fresh veggies are just that, boiled veggies. Could have been made a little fancier IMO. Overall great food, better than it looks, and warm environment.","I got used to having chick fil a on a weekly basis due to being a student at Byu so after being out of school for a while I craved a good chick fil a sandwich. I got my usual order of a spicy chicken deluxe meal. After bringing it home, the first thing I noticed was that it was not quite as fresh and hot as I was used to. I live very close to the location but by the time I was home the chicken felt lukewarm. Despite this, the flavor of the sandwich was amazing and the fries were crispy and salty as usual.","We go once a year for a birthday. Somehow they were able to reproduce almost the exact same experience they provided to us last year tonight \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur party of 4 had a reservation and still had to wait 30 minutes to be seated. \u00a0Once seated, we \u00a0asked for a few minutes to look over the menu. \u00a020 minutes later our server came back to take our order. \u00a0I ordered a taco salad with the Avocado on the side. \u00a0Two dishes came out first within a reasonable amount of time. \u00a0Then the 3rd order was served. \u00a0The other diners \u00a0all commented on how good their selections were, and were mostly done eating when our server finally came to check on us and seemed surprised that I had not been served yet. \u00a0Finally a manager brought out my salad with avocado mixed throughout and said that my salad had been served to another table. She offered to remake it but by then everyone else would be done and staring at me eating, so I took the old one and spent a lot of time picking it out. \u00a0The salad was a total disappointment. I won\u0026#39;t order that again. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThey attempted to rectify the issues with a free piece of cheesecake. \u00a0A nice gesture, but not enough to make me pick this restaurant for my upcoming birthday dinner. \u00a0I can only hope the family member who has the birthday today doesn\u0026#39;t pick it again next year."
"3 1/2 out of 5. Local BBQ chain. Large facility with a young and energetic staff that was eager to please. We shared a three meat platter that included Tri-tip, brisket, and lemon chicken. All were somewhere between average and good when accompanied with the spicy BBQ sauce provided on the table. Also tried the raspberry Q sauce, but found it to be too sweet for our taste.The sides of baked beans and pepper jack mac \u0026amp; cheese were exceptional.","Chick Fil A, \u0026#34;RISE AND SHOUT!\u0026#34;\u003cbr\u003eNear the BYU campus, we skipped the hotel\u0026#39;s free breakfast to go experience the yummy CFA Mini\u0026#39;s in Zion!\u003cbr\u003eThe service was quick, the food was scrumptious, and we went for the Splenda lemonade to start our morning. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI had barely backed into my curbside delivery spot when the food was on its way out the door. \u003cbr\u003eThank you for making us feel at home with the best breakfast we\u0026#39;ve had in a while","The Cheesecake Factory is pretty much just average.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere aren\u0026#39;t many bad things to say about it, but there also aren\u0026#39;t many great things to say about it. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere\u0026#39;s what we like: \u003cbr\u003e-The appetizer bread. They give you a few whole wheat pieces and a few sourdough pieces. They are both good! \u003cbr\u003e-The cheesecake. I think homemade cheesecake is much better, but their cheesecake is still good.\u003cbr\u003e-Variety. There\u0026#39;s a lot of variety in their menu. They have various appetizers and entrees, and there is something for everyone on the menu! They also have the \u0026#34;skinnylicious\u0026#34; menu with dishes that aren\u0026#39;t very high in calories.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere\u0026#39;s what could be better:\u003cbr\u003e-The prices. $8 for a single piece of cheesecake?! That\u0026#39;s pretty outrageous. Their meals are also pretty pricey. \u003cbr\u003e-The food. The food isn\u0026#39;t bad by any means, but it\u0026#39;s also not going to keep me coming back. If you\u0026#39;re going to charge so much for a meal, it needs to be a dang good meal. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Cheesecake Factory isn\u0026#39;t bad. I like it! There are just other places I would choose to eat instead based on taste and price of food."
"The food is delicious and they have great lunch specials. Also, pretty unique compared to other BBQ places.","I really don\u0026#39;t eat a lot of fast food, but I need to hand it to Chick-fil-A. We took the kids there at their request for a family night. I was instantly impressed with how clean the restaurant was and how nice everyone was.\u003cbr\u003eThe food was really good, much higher quality than what I expected. Everyone was happy. The kids had chicken, macaroni \u0026amp; cheese and fruit. Every detail was covered, down to the placemats for the kids. I had the superfood salad, it\u0026#39;s quite small for a full meal, but it is really really good.\u003cbr\u003eKudos to Chick-fil-A. What a great experience!","It\u0026#39;s ridiculous how long the wait was for this place. If I could give them zero stars I would. My family and I were out on a waiting list and told us we had to wait for 2 hours. We waited and didn\u0026#39;t understand why after two hours they still did not have seating. Their excuse was a big family, who had already finished their meal would not stop talking and leave. My mom is diabetic, and so she almost fainted due to low blood sugar, because they couldn\u0026#39;t accommodate us like they said they would. The Cheese Cake Factory has TERRIBLE SERVICE!! We ended up going to a small local restaurant called Joy Luck in Bountiful. They had our food ready in 20mins! I\u0026#39;m glad our money went to a place much more deserving of it."
"We are visiting from California and wanted to find something yummy to eat without the humongous wait. We found this place through yelp and loved it. The people there are extremely nice, need something, all you have to do is ask and they will bend over backwards to get it for you. The portion sizes are good, and the desserts are ALL yummy.","Ordered a spicy chicken deluxe combo with extra crispy fries. Delicious! I will definitely be asking for extra crispy fries from now on. The only dissatisfaction is that I asked for no ice in my drink, but they still put ice in.","It\u0026#39;s terrible I have to come on and even give 1 star I wish I could leave 0. I normally love cheesecake factory but this location needs new staff. Maddie is very unprofessional and rude she\u0026#39;s a hostess here at this location, We come in yesterday for lunch and my friend has a heart condition and as soon as we come\u003cbr\u003eThrough the door she screamed at her for not having a mask on and wouldn\u0026#39;t let her explain her case told her she cant eat here without one and has to leave. Wouldn\u0026#39;t Even let her explain. Will not be coming back to this location because of Maddie. Then she told me were five minutes late for our reservation so will have to Wait 20 minutes. And she also screamed at me and I had a mask on.I think she\u0026#39;s racist!! I will be going to the the Cheesecake Factory downtown from now on business elsewhere!!! I repeat do not go to this location and save your self go downtown until they get \u00a0Maddie the hostess under control!!!!! She made me and my family and my two-year-old son very uncomfortable she kept staring and pointing and whispering to other workers in there also!!"

This place was awesome.",This particular experience was rather different than most. Our order taker forgot to ask us for sauce and when we got our food we only received 2 sauce packets when we ordered enough food for a small army. We were missing drinks when we received our food as well. This location constantly gives me trouble but I\u0026#39;m addicted to Chick-fil-a so I guess I\u0026#39;m stuck.,"The cheesecake factory has always been a favorite of mine, I always choose to go there for celebrations. Just always plan to have a little wait before being seated, but its so worth it! The dining area is very classy, and elegant. The have so many different kinds of cheesecake like cookies and creme, and cookie dough. If you go there you have to try the Breaded Macaroni Bites, they have absolutely delicious! There service is always impeccable, and there food is always amazing gourmet food!"
"I was genuinely surprised by the courtesy of the staff on this return visit of ours. My wife and I ordered The Sampler to share and I really enjoyed what they brought to the table this time around. Their spicy pepper jack mac and cheese had a zesty flavor that was a wonderful kick start to the meal, the bleu cheese salad felt very put rather than slapped together while being both potent and enjoyable, and the rolls included were delicious and buttery with the addition of honey butter. The tri-tip steak was great and I was very pleased that this time around you could tell they put time into their recipe, and the same goes for the chicken which was moist and seasoned just right. The brisket was a little dry for me and I would have liked a fattier cut of meat, but I was informed afterwards that this is an available option, you just order while specifying that you want your brisket \u0026#34;wet.\u0026#34; The smoky taste was delightful despite my critiques though. Lastly, I felt that the ribs had a well-designed recipe, but were drier than my own personal taste (my wife loved them, so it really is a personal preference thing more than anything else.) Not only were these great options, the price of The Sampler makes it a competitive BBQ option that is able to provide both good meat and good sides, something most BBQ places struggle to provide (generally one or the other.) I think they\u0026#39;ve won me over this time, and I\u0026#39;m excited to guide my wife in that direction the next time she wants a BBQ night.",There is no point to having your employees wear masks that only cover mouths and not noses. \u00a0Looking at two right now. \u00a0Same thing last time we came. \u00a0This will be our last trip here.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe just pulled up to pay and the girl had her mask below her nose and mouth. \u00a0 \u00a0When you first drive up there is the illusion with masks and gloves. \u00a0But just an illusion in a state whose numbers are on the rise.,"We went during the Covid-19 mess shortly after the dining room reopened. We made a reservation on Yelp and arrived 5 minutes early and were seated within 5 minutes of our reservation time. (FYI: Reservations are held for no more than 5 minutes past your time.) My daughter and I have a cheesecake for lunch tradition to start and end the school year so this is obviously our go to spot! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe hostess today was very unfriendly and seemed bothered by everyone who walked up to the counter during the 10 minutes we waited on our designated spot for our table. Very short in her responses, limited to no eye contact, actually yelled the name of a guest several times to tell him his party needed to wait outside. She was short with other staff members as well. The rest of the staff was delightful! Particularly our server, Kylee D. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eKylee went above and beyond to make our outing special. She was that way for all of the tables around us to. She displayed a genuine interest in our outing and checked on us frequently. Our cups were never empty and our food was delivered promptly and delicious! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThey are following the Governor\u0026#39;s Directive and I was very impressed with the steps they\u0026#39;ve taken to promote social distancing and sanitation. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eKylee, 5\u003cbr\u003eFood, 4 ($3.50 for a soda is ridiculous!)\u003cbr\u003eHostess, 1"
"I enjoyed the option for Bundaberg sodas, but flavor, portion size and price were in general not competitive or enticing enough for a second visit.","Chicken is okay, but there are plenty of more delicious chicken places in the area. Okay service with poor morals.","We have been coming here for a couple years now and the service has never been more than \u0026#39;okay\u0026#39;. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere are a few recommendations from my experiences:\u003cbr\u003e- If you are calling in to place an order, expect to be on hold for a minimum of 5 minutes and be transferred a couple times before someone is willing to take your order. \u003cbr\u003e- When dining in (even on a weekday), you will need to go on a long waiting list so make sure you arrive well before you plan on eating. The best dine in option is to sit at the bar as it is first come first serve seating. Many people may not know it but the tall, round tabletops are also apart of the bar and first come first serve. This is a great option if you don\u0026#39;t want to wait and you don\u0026#39;t mind being closer to the bar.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eObviously with the COVID epidemic, in-store dining is not an option so I had to place my to go order by phone today. When I called in, the attendant seemed bothered that I was calling. Before placing my order she made sure to make it a point to say that she highly recommends placing the order online rather than over the phone (although they had just opened the store and there weren\u0026#39;t more than a couple cars waiting to be served). I proceeded to place my order of the California Omelette and some cheesecake for later. Surprisingly, the wait was less than 20 minutes and the sweet lady that delivered it was very personable and helpful.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis was my first time ordering the California Omelette because my usual order of the eggs Benedict wasn\u0026#39;t available on their limited menu today. I have to say, I was so pleasantly surprised with how savory the omelette was that I didn\u0026#39;t even notice it was a vegetarian omelette. It had avocados, mushrooms, green onions, tomatoes, garlic and cheese. It also came with breakfast potatoes that were the perfect consistency and topped with caramelized onions with a side of english muffins. All of this food for $12? I definitely got a bang for my buck. One thing I have to say is that the consistency of Cheesecake Factory\u0026#39;s food is always exceptionally good. Although their service may not always be up to par, they\u0026#39;re food always tastes just as savory each time you go."
"Pretty yummy Aussie inspired BBQ joint. I recommend giving it a try!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThey have some pretty good deals in my opinion. Especially for lunch. I went with the brisket smokehouse meal. You can pick the meat you want, two different sides, and then it comes with a roll and cinnamon butter. The brisket was a good choice. I was very pleased with it. I was also pleased with the different BBQ sauces you can choose from. I think everyone will be able to find something here they like! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt can be a little loud sometimes. And they need to clear and clean the tables a little more frequently. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis place isn\u0026#39;t anything insanely special. But if you are in the area and need a yummy place to stop for food, go ahead and come here.","It was divine, I don\u0026#39;t know how but chic fil a has figured out how to make liquid gold and put it in their sauce. Thanks for making my day",The employees at this location is unbelievable there rudeness to there customers is highly unprofessional\u0026#39; I will never return for how they treat me an my family take your money an Business elsewhere or to the downtown location #Boycott #Wrostchessecakefactory
"Went in with no line and we still waited 20 minutes for our food. On top of that my meat (brisket and turkey) were COLD!! How in the world did it take so long and my food was still cold?? I am willing to give them another chance because I have had good food here before, but was thoroughly disappointed with my experience.","Emmett took care of us; very professional and personable young man. Fresh, hot- food always on point!","I\u0026#39;ve been to this location a couple other times. \u00a0One was a lunch back when it first opened and it wasn\u0026#39;t memorable. The second time was to take cheesecake to go, and the third was on the new years eve of 2018 waiting for 2019 to come in. \u00a0Every time the place has been very crowded (especially NYE). \u00a0If you plan on coming to the Cheesecake Factory (CF), I would recommend showing up at least thirty minutes before you would like to actually eat. \u00a0Maybe more depending on whether it\u0026#39;s a holiday or a weekend night. \u00a0Just prepare for a wait, and prepare to possibly wait in an area where people are packed together like sardines in a can or wait outside.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen my dining companion and I arrived and put our names on the waiting list, we were told it would be about 45 minutes, which that was pretty accurate. \u00a0It would be nice if they took reservations (and I know that yelp has a reservation system with them, but not before 4:30 so I can\u0026#39;t comment on how well that works), but with how popular they are, I can see why they might not because then it would become difficult for walk-ins to get seated.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen we were seated, the hostess sat us in a dinky booth/table. \u00a0It was one of those tables where you could seat a very large party or split the tables to seat small parties. \u00a0Our table was right at the end and honestly it was pretty uncomfortable, and I\u0026#39;m a fairly slender person. \u00a0Our server, Gabi showed up promptly and seeing as how the people in the booth across from us were getting ready to leave, we asked if it was possible for us to move there when they left. \u00a0After checking with the host(ess), Gabi moved us to the booth after they left. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe ordered water to drink and shared the pretzel bites for an appetizer. \u00a0It was good while it was warm but the cheese cooled fairly quickly and sort of congealed in a way that wasn\u0026#39;t very appetizing. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI ordered the stuffed cheddar burger and added bacon on it for an extra cost; fries were my side. \u00a0The burger was good. \u00a0Not stand out of the crowd good, but it was basically what I expect from a burger from this type of restaurant. \u00a0I\u0026#39;d read the description of the bacon on the bacon cheese burger which was what had prompted me to get bacon on my burger, but the bacon really didn\u0026#39;t seem to fit the description on the menu. \u00a0I expected a thicker bacon than what I got. \u00a0The flavor of the bacon was good though. \u00a0 \u00a0The stuffed cheddar burger is filled with cheese, so expect it to kind of ooze out when you take a bite. \u00a0The fries were standard fries. \u00a0Nothing special.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy dining companion ordered the crusted chicken romano. \u00a0He said that he felt like it was good comfort food and that the quality was what he would expect from the CF. \u00a0He also says that he thinks that most people might find the dish bland, but for his sense of taste it was perfect. \u00a0His only complaint was that he would have liked more sauce on the pasta.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe each ordered a piece of cheesecake, his to stay, mine to go. \u00a0He ordered the cinnabon cinnamon swirl and I ordered the ultimate red velvet. \u00a0Both were delicious, though my dining companion thought that the red velvet had a strange aftertaste. \u00a0He liked the cinnabon one though, and said that it didn\u0026#39;t have a strange aftertaste.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe restaurant was fairly clean, though the bathrooms could have used some attention and one of the faucets wouldn\u0026#39;t turn off which is sort of off-putting given that we\u0026#39;re in a desert and there are cities in the world that are literally running out of water, so I hope that they get that fixed soon. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOverall, the experience was \u0026#39;A-OK\u0026#39; as is noted by the 3 star rating. \u00a0It was good, but it wasn\u0026#39;t amazing. \u00a0The food was okay, but I\u0026#39;ve never felt particularly WOWed by CF\u0026#39;s food and this particular visit was no exception. \u00a0The one thing about CF is that in general the service I\u0026#39;ve received has been good and our server Gabi was awesome. \u00a0The cheesecake is the star of the show I\u0026#39;d say that I would come back to get cheesecake to go before I would come back for food."
Amazed again. I discovered wallaby\u0026#39;s 5years ago and went back for some beef. Got a plate full for lunch for an amazing price. See photo.,"If I could a combo of their amazing fries, switch off between a chicken sandwich (no pickles) and a 8 piece chicken nugget, I don\u0026#39;t think I would need to eat anywhere else the rest of my life. God bless this place and the friendly staff.","We were surprised there was a wait for a table on a weekday night but it was !\u003cbr\u003eOur party consisted of 4 people and the wait was just 20 min which was surprising considering their lobby was full. \u003cbr\u003eWhen we got seated the waitress cam by pretty fast and asked for our drink orders. She came back quickly and with bread. \u003cbr\u003eWe ordered chicken Madeira, chicken bellagio, chopped salad and tomato, basil and cheese flat bread\u003cbr\u003eWe got our food quickly, and it was delicious. The waitress was attentive and kind. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe cons are that they are in the pricier side. Granted they have larger portions but still. The place is pretty loud \u00a0and crowded so it makes it hard to have a conversation. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOverall it was good!"
"I\u0026#39;ve had wallaby\u0026#39;s multiple times catered and have always been super impressed. Finally dined in and I left underwhelmed. Just lacking in a few things, like hot food. Service was super friendly and very helpful. I will say this - the pulled pork is the way to go here. They definitely nail that. And they have delicious BBQ sauce. The mashed potatoes (or smashers or whatever they call them) are usually quite good. As is the salad. And we were impressed with the baked beans. \u003cbr\u003eThe shrimp was very overcooked and rubbery. So don\u0026#39;t go there. Steak and chicken were both decent. The lemon pepper chicken doesn\u0026#39;t taste like lemon pepper at all though. \u003cbr\u003eI\u0026#39;m going with 4 stars as a combination of different experiences. I will hope that in-dining experiences can go up just a bit.","I know, I know. This is a fast food chicken restaurant that we are talking about. But I truly believe they deserve every single one of those 5 stars. I think the thing about Chick fil a is they care about two things: yummy food and a good customer experience.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI haven\u0026#39;t been to a location that I didn\u0026#39;t think was awesome, but I have been particularly impressed with this one. One time we came after my sister had just lost an important soccer game and she was feeling pretty down. One of the workers came out to our table with an ice cream cone and said, \u0026#34;you look like you could use some free ice cream.\u0026#34; What?? How awesome is that?? If Chick fil a alone wasn\u0026#39;t going to make my sister feel better, the kind employees and free ice cream sure did. The employees at Chick fil a have been consistently kind and helpful. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe other thing about this location is it is always busy. But that doesn\u0026#39;t effect your experience at all! They have figured out a system! They are organized and can still help you quickly. I went the other day and there was a lot of obnoxious construction for the new Target in the parking lot. Chick fil a brought on extra workers to be outside helping to direct people and taking orders. The manager was even outside helping customers. What you would normally think would have taken 45 minutes took us only about 7. So impressed! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOk I know I have rambling on and on about the experience, but the food is GREAT too. I am always craving it. I love the 8 count nuggets with PLENTY of Chick fil a sauce. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love this place and I will always be a frequent customer!","Service is good, the food tho... The pretzels were burnt, and I ordered my steak rare not raw. Overall everything was ight."
"The second you walk in, your mouth starts watering. The restaurant is clean and stylish! My boyfriend and I each got wings, the sweet and spicy sauce was delightful. The prices are wonderful and the staff is great. Found out about this place through a BYU basketball game and I will definitely be coming back!",There food is so good! I love their classic chick-fil-a sandwich and the spicy one too. They also have such good service! Love chick-fil-a and their people!,The Murray location is consistent... consistently poor service. It is unreal. Every time!
"For my first visit, I was very impressed. \u00a0 \u00a0Let\u0026#39;s start with the interior. \u00a0 It\u0026#39;s outback with a cabin feel. \u00a0 You start at the Counter and order from there then your food is delivered to your table.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThey have every kind of BBQ meat you can imagine and I had Shrimp on the Barbie. \u00a0 It came with loaded smashed potatoes, a salad and a melt in your mouth roll all for less than $14.00.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe value for the food you get is amazing. \u00a0I can\u0026#39;t eat at a normal take out \u00a0for close to this price. \u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy only wish is they would build one near my house like the middle of Salt Lake City would work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf not Orem is not too far away and I will be back.","Poor customer service , I stood about 5 minutes in front of the register and every employee just kept walking by me , until I finally said excuse me, \u00a0poor poor service and it\u0026#39;s not the 1st time","Lovely dining setting for my anniversary. When we arrived we arrived about 5 minutes late due to traffic and were told our table wasn\u0026#39;t ready. We then waiting for another 20 minutes. We didn\u0026#39;t mind too much since we weren\u0026#39;t in much of a rush but then the waits to be able to order and then finally receiving our food got to be a bit too much. We did not receive our appetizer until after our food because we had to remind them, they had forgotten it. But the Pasta Carbonara was delicious, the Angel hair with Shrimp was good (the shrimp was fantastic), and the Fried Mac n\u0026#39; Cheese balls were great as well as the salted caramel cheesecake. Food was overall good, but the service can always improve."
"I was really hoping for something better than this.\u003cbr\u003eI ordered sliced brisket, smoked turkey, and tri-tip for my meats. Loaded mashers, and rice and beans for my sides.\u003cbr\u003eMy wife ordered shrimp on the barbie.\u003cbr\u003eHere\u0026#39;s the criticism.... \u00a0\u003cbr\u003eMy brisket was chopped, cold, and tasted like unseasoned beef that had been reheated multiple times, it fell apart before I could get it to my mouth and had little to no smokiness.\u003cbr\u003eSmoked Turkey tasted good but again was cold and dried out.\u003cbr\u003eTri-tip was good but was poor quality meat and was rush cooked so it was tuff and dry.\u003cbr\u003eLoaded mashers were delicious, rice and beans were only good because of the mystery mayo stuff on top give them some type of zesty moisture.\u003cbr\u003eMy wife\u0026#39;s shrimp was delicious, but really how hard is it to screw up shrimp on a closed face grill? She also had cucumber salad and fresh veggies. Veggies were cooked very well and the cucumber salad was good but was not fresh.\u003cbr\u003eI would have given Wallabys 2 stars but my half rack of ribs tasted like old cat food and created dust as the bones were pulled out.\u003cbr\u003eBones arent supposed to just pull out, they are way way passed overcooked at that point. \u003cbr\u003eIf this was a real smoke house they\u0026#39;d be out of business by now. Dickeys is a 5 star restaurant compared to wallabys and dickeys is average at best. My last gripe. They say it is supposed to be Aussie inspired. Was the names you gave the american foods about it? \u003cbr\u003eNever again.","WHO DOESN\u0026#39;T LOVE CHICK-FIL-A?! It always hits the spot. Always friendly service, and the fastest drive through ever. Today I ordered through the mobile app and my food was brought out to me within a minute of arriving! It doesn\u0026#39;t get much better than that.",What an enjoyable night we had. When going to The Cheesecake Factory you know it\u0026#39;s not going to the quietest evening but that you\u0026#39;ll leave with a full tummy of delicious food. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur waitress was amazing and never left our drinks more than half empty or the table a mess. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe cucumber lemonade is amazing! I crave it in the regular. I got the Crispy Chicken Costoletta and my husband got the Chicken Alfredo. Both were delicious and highly recommended.
"I have been to this location of Wallaby\u0026#39;s a couple of times. If you\u0026#39;re having cravings for BBQ and don\u0026#39;t have the time to cook your own, Wallaby\u0026#39;s will suffice. It won\u0026#39;t \u0026#34;hit the spot\u0026#34; or have you craving their particular version of barbecue, but it will do when you want those generic flavors.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn spite of the Aussie theme, Wallaby\u0026#39;s seems to go after eastern Texas barbecue, with sauces based on ketchup and brown sugar. Ultimately, though, the only thing they seem to really get \u0026#34;right\u0026#34; is the cinnamon honey butter. It\u0026#39;s whipped and light and oozing with flavor. When eating there, I prefer to fill up on that butter on their soft rolls.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe meats are highly disappointing. I don\u0026#39;t believe Wallaby\u0026#39;s smokes any of its meats. There was no semblance of a smoke ring on any meats, nor any wood flavor. The moistness of the brisket was the only thing going for it--it had no flavor of its own. The same goes for the drier pulled pork: it was bland, seemed to have been trimmed of all fat prior to roasting, and needed some serious seasoning and smoking. It\u0026#39;s usually my favorite meat but was the worst of the ones I\u0026#39;ve tried here. The barbecue chicken is only the top choice because the sauce it\u0026#39;s swimming in imparts flavor and moisture.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI haven\u0026#39;t tried the ribs, but if I come back they will be what I order.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSides are bland and lacking in butter and seasoning. The salad is unimaginative. The potatoes are meh, and the cake is very dry. Like I said, the only thing you\u0026#39;ll love will likely be the butter. Ultimately, I can make better barbecue in my own kitchen sans smoking equipment, and you probably can, too. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe service at this location is quick and friendly, which helps \u0026#34;up\u0026#34; the rating in my opinion.","Their chicken is REAL chicken (not that processed crap like other places. Their service is great! (They say things like \u0026#34;My pleasure\u0026#34;), the place is very clean and their employees are always friendly. \u00a0And even though they are always busy, they are fast \u0026amp; efficient.","To start, the avocado egg roll was paired with a sweet chili sauce. The steak Dianne was cooked to a perfect medium! \u00a0Although too full for cheesecake myself, I did order a slice of Dulce de Leche cheesecake to take to another friend \u00a0I was seeing later. \u00a0She loved it!"

The food is often mediocre and not worth what you pay. I got the orange chicken and it was good but not $15 dollars good. I could find store bought chicken that tastes just as good. It wasn\u0026#39;t super flavorful and didn\u0026#39;t taste very fresh. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe really bad part was the rice. Completely over-cooked and soggy. It was just mush. Let\u0026#39;s just say if I molded it into a ball it would be a solid. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI could go to an authentic hole in the wall restaurant and get far superior orange chicken and rice for half the price. Unfortunately this was kind of the last straw for me here. It\u0026#39;s just overrated.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI really love how well they train their servers. Some of the best! But ours wasn\u0026#39;t able to do anything for us when I told them about the rice.
"We love the food and service at Wallabys. All of their food is homemade and fresh. The meats have that beautiful, mouth watering smoke ring. The sides are homemade. My favorite is the cucumber salad followed by the rice and beans. The coleslaw has a creamy dressing with sliced carrots and shredded cabbage. The salads are my least favorite things because the lettuce isn\u0026#39;t cold and crisp.\u003cbr\u003eBe sure to try the pomegranate lemonade. I love this stuff.\u003cbr\u003eThey have really tasty bbq shrimp skewers. The brisket is fork tender. The ribs are lip smacking good.",MSG!!! Not as healthy as you think!!! Waste of money to spend to find out you that it\u0026#39;s a rip off. Come and take out the MSG!!!,I feel like I never pick a good meal when I go here but this time I got the Hibachi Steak and it was really good! Really tender and flavorful. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe fried asparagus was my favorite. The mashed potatoes were very average and a little bland but I liked how they kept the skins.

"One of the best smokehouses to. The meats are tender and smokey. The shrimp are cooked perfect. The homemade rolls are so good. They serve them with cinnamon butter, but I like just good old butter which they also offer. The cucumbers are a favorite side as well as the rice and beans and the coleslaw. The tossed salads are hit and miss. The tossed salads usually aren\u0026#39;t very fresh, crisp or cold. There is plenty of seating. The prices are very reasonable for a smokehouse BBQ.",It\u0026#39;s a chain for food and they OK but just something missing just can\u0026#39;t put my down side to this place. When they get your order \u00a0wrong it just suck up your hold meal. To many times this had happen so I avoid going them and prices are high for a sub-stranded sandwich or anything else you order.

The whole thing seem disorganized.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy husband\u0026#39;s food was over salted. I stuck with appetizers and mine meal was fine.

Sydney was so cute and helpful!!! We didn\u0026#39;t particularly enjoy the mac n cheese and she was so helpful and nice and figured it out for us!! Love her,I normally love chick-fil-a but this location has consistently given me stale fries and cold sandwiches. I normally tolerate it because I use so much chick-fil-a sauce (which is amazing) to make it okay but they\u0026#39;ve messed up my order the last two times as well. I would\u0026#39;ve gone back but with Corona going on I don\u0026#39;t find it worth it.,"Honestly- we usually love Cheesecake Factory. We were so happy to see that they offered curbside pick up, but because of how they handled their curbside pick up during Covid, we\u0026#39;ll never go again. No one is wearing masks (employees were but no patrons), it\u0026#39;s just as busy as before - people acting as if there isn\u0026#39;t a pandemic, and their curbside pick up blocks traffic and defeats the purpose of being safe and utilizing their curbside pick up. Why don\u0026#39;t you guys use the curbside to go spots? It would clear up traffic and be safer. We had to call in and tell someone where we were here and still had to wait 30+ minutes for it. My husband had to go inside and ask someone for help - which defeats the purpose of us using to curbside option- If you\u0026#39;re going to open during a pandemic and offer options to your patrons to avoid eating inside, then make sure the plan works. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso- we got home and I do not recommend paying more for chicken. I literally had 3 pieces in my pasta. So glad we had a gift card and didn\u0026#39;t have to pay $50+ for a crappy situation."
This place is nothing to write home about. The meat was super dry and over cooked. Side dishes were bland.

Both are heavenly delicious! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI would also recommend the Dulce de Leche Cheesecake... it does not disappoint."
"A friend of mine recommended Wallabys awhile back so of course I had to try it! Maybe it was because I was hyped up about it, maybe it\u0026#39;s just the Aussie BBQ style, but I wasn\u0026#39;t the hugest fan. I ordered a bbq pulled pork sandwich and didn\u0026#39;t enjoy the bbq sauce on the pork as much as I had wanted too. It was more spicy than savory so I felt like my taste buds were let down a little. I much rather have some Bam Bams. Another thing that was weird was their service style. You place your order and wait for it. I like other places like bam bams or five star where you can actually see them make your food. I understand that they serve fries and theoretically it should take longer but I like the process of other bbq joints.","Their employees, especially their team lead Chelsea, provide such great service and the food is always high quality. I never have to wait for long even when they\u0026#39;re super busy!","I know COVID is going on and what not, but there was literally no one in the lobby area in Cheese cake factory and the manager made me and my 7month old daughter go outside. I had my mask on and everything and again NO one was waiting we were the ONLY ones in the area. It\u0026#39;s almost 100 degrees outside and he told us we had to wait out there. When I asked what he thought the turn around time was her said 15 minutes like I said a few minutes ago. Which he spoke to my husband not me so I wasn\u0026#39;t aware of the time frame. Rude....not cool and extremely inconsiderate."
"Is there anything better than BBQ and lemonade!? If you\u0026#39;re looking for amazing BBQ, and really good Mac n\u0026#39; cheese, rolls and mashed potatoes sound good to you too... Wallabys is your stop. Also- Gary is the man! \u003cbr\u003eWhat I recommend ordering is below: \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Their famous brisket and pulled pork (they have a variety of bbq sauces you can choose from as well)\u003cbr\u003e-Mac n\u0026#39; Cheese (perfectly cooked and topped with bread crumbs)\u003cbr\u003e-Rolls (buttery soft rolls, serves with a side of cinnamon/honey butter!) \u003cbr\u003e-Smashers (creamy mashed potatoes, topped with shredded cheese)","I love Chick-fil-A! \u00a0 \u00a0The chicken noodle soup is my favorite! \u00a0The salads are amazing! \u00a0The sandwiches are real chicken and delicious! \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It\u0026#39;s a clean place if I go inside -- I get through the drive through in a very reasonable amount of time! \u00a0 \u00a0I leave happy, \u00a0and full!","The food tasted great like always.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe staff at this location isn\u0026#39;t the greatest. I have had experiences here that were normal, but this last time, our waiter was pretty bad. Didn\u0026#39;t talk to us, and he walked away mid conversation. Didn\u0026#39;t deserve a tip, but still gave it for the cooking staff.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCity Creek Location way better."
"3.7. Hmmm... Hmmmm.... Hmmmm... This was a real tough one. I am glad we got the 25 dollar sampler. But this place left me so confused as to how i should feel that i decided to write a review, and judge those who work hard to create.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRibs- delicious\u003cbr\u003eTritip (only had a sample) - delicious wish i would have this instead of the...\u003cbr\u003ePulled Pork- not good. not bad. no taste, no salt, not nothing just... pork.\u003cbr\u003eBrisket- yummy, and good with a small dab of BBQ suace.\u003cbr\u003eChipotle chicken ummm--- also a good. i recommend it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSides:\u003cbr\u003eMac n Cheese - Cheesy and good but eat it quickly once it goes cold... game over.\u003cbr\u003eMashed potatoes - they tasted like... mashed potatoes, so if you like those get um.\u003cbr\u003eColeslaw - i could have gone for some more dressing, very dry and it reminded me of snow ball christmas cookies... which since you arent related to me makes no sense.\u003cbr\u003eBake beans - the beans were very tough as if not cooked all the way which is super sad because the taste was sooooooo good, a little brown sugar and some spicy something. (something is as descriptive as i get).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTHE VERDICT: Because the ribs and trip trip were so good i gave them a four... you know what, im changing it to a three as we speak. because if im a \u0026#34;fan\u0026#34; doesnt that mean I will go back? I highly doubt i will go back to this place unless i really want tri tip. \u00a0I feel like my tone has been overly harsh this entire time so... in order to make everyone feel better, popo pipi caca.","I love coming to this Chick-fil-A! Even though it can get pretty busy, they always keep it fast moving with short wait times. The restaurant itself was extremely clean and a bright atmosphere! My cashier was Bethany and she was so kind and helpful! The managers here are doing a great job!","Great as always. We had exceptional service with Devin. Our drinks were never empty and we had a party of 8. My husband and I split the Steak Diane, our toddler had bow tie pasta with meatballs and we got the dulce de leche cheesecake. We loved our experience. Yummy food, great atmosphere, and wonderful service."
"Resoundingly average barbecue. My BBQ beef was good, but all meat is good if you slow-cook/smoke it and dump barbecue sauce on it. I\u0026#39;m more interested in the rest of the meal: lackluster salad greens, reconstituted baked beans, and a roll so mediocre that not even a heavy layer of butter could make it worth the carbs.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo be fair, most barbecue places totally whiff the side dishes. The only place in the valley I can honestly recommend is Blues Street.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn a side note, do Australians even have their own food? I mean, all the Australian places I know just serve steak and fried-egg burgers. Pretty light on originality, if you ask me.","One of my favorite restaurants, to be honest. Yes, it\u0026#39;s fast food, but it\u0026#39;s more than that. The entire grilled menu offers a healthy option for their delectable chicken, and the service is so fast and nice. The store is always kept perfectly clean and is the perfect mix of casual dining and cute decorative rustic accents.",You make a reservation and then when you arrive there is no direction as to what you do next. Line out the door. People cutting the line and going through the exit. Standing in line not sure if the people you\u0026#39;re in line with also have reservations or if their just taking a chance at being seated. Remembering that if your 5 minutes late your reservation is gone. Kind of crazy and pretty stressful since we had to drive 40 minutes to get here. Food is ok here. Server was nice. City Creek one is all around better.
"I\u0026#39;m still torn about this place. The advertising is definitely less than honest, which is a huge bother for me. But the food seems to be better each time I come. My wife really likes the turkey here, and what my Bebe wants she gets, so I get swindled into spending my hard \u00a0earned dollars here.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe tri tip is actually really good, I recommend coming on Tuesday when you can get it in the lunch special. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe service is always really friendly. I like the flow of the restaurant and they have a plethora of original sauces, The zesty BBQ makes me wanna slap my grandma \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThey also have sports playing, which would be nice if you could hear it over the corny Katy Perry type music they have blasting","I was very disappointed in this chic-fil-a. I went in the drive through during lunch and I get they were busy, but it took \u00a0forever to get through, which is fine. I finally got to the window to pay after waiting a while in line and I pay and the employee looks at me and says, \u0026#34; hey it looks like your food is going to take a bit, can you drive up to the vip section and we will bring it out to you.\u0026#34; All I ordered were two sandwiches so it wasn\u0026#39;t a big order at all. I drive to the VIP section and I wait for ten cars that were behind me in line before I go inside. They all got their food before me and I couldn\u0026#39;t figure out why. I talked to the cashier and she did everything she could to get my order complete ASAP. They let four other cars go through and we\u0026#39;re giving them sandwiches. It was an awful experience and I will not be back to this chic-fil-a until they figure it out.",The food is super yummy and the service is great! I also get workers that have a huge smile on their face and seem to be happy that they are there. I love their chicken dishes and Oreo cheesecake. It is delicious. It is also in a convenient location for shopping while waiting for a table.
"They advertise 2 meals for $17, and exclude the meals that actually make it possible to save money by using the deal. There are much better BBQ places in the area at much better prices with more sound business practices..lol i need a life","Chick-fil-A is the only fast food I eat -- mostly because it\u0026#39;s quality doesn\u0026#39;t feel like fast food. The service is always top-notch (and very friendly), I get my food quickly and the establishments are always clean. I would honestly eat at Chick-fil-A every day if I could!",I get it. We are in unusual times and I\u0026#39;m sure there are people there working their ass off during this Covid bullshit. But there were people waiting there for literally 2.5 hours when they were given pickup times. What\u0026#39;s troubling is when I went in to cancel there must have been 40+ bags just sitting there. No one touched them. No one called any names. The staff at the cheesecake bar were just giggling putting whipped cream on cake. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAbsolutely ZERO management or order. I knew I should have stuck with Red Rock.
I love the food. Even as a gluten free eater- I have YUMMY options to eat. I could eat here all the time!!,"As busy as this location was (spring break, so there were kids by the boat load), we still received our orders as quickly as normal.","Sat at the bar tonight to try and dodge the long line. And it worked! The bartender was phenomenal, the service was great, and the food and drinks were SO GOOD. The cocktails and food just hit the spot so well. Come here!"
"Pretty good place for quick BBQ. All around good food, decent service, nice atmosphere. Hard to say it\u0026#39;s the best BBQ because of the competition around Utah Valley but a nice lunch spot or for some take out dinner. Occasionally, they offer two entrees, four sides, and dessert for $25 which is a great deal for the amount of food we\u0026#39;re getting compared to their regular menu price. They also do daily specials that gives a little discount to sweeten up the deal. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI personally always go for the tri-tip steak every time. They never overcook it but they are also flexible if you request it cooked a certain way (for me, rare is the only way to go). Every meal comes with a roll and two sides. I\u0026#39;m not much for bread, but their rolls with some cinnamon butter hits the spot. Get the mac n cheese, SO good. I\u0026#39;ve also tried their chicken and that has proven to be worth to ordering as well. Not a big fan of their brisket and pulled pork, but I\u0026#39;ve only had a taste so perhaps it\u0026#39;s not a just judgement. I LOVE their oreo brownie sundae. It is fantastic, I would come here just for dessert and nothing else. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe service is friendly and food comes pretty quickly. There is always plenty of seating. My one gripe about this place is that the meat is smaller portions than expected. Sometimes it\u0026#39;s all right with me, others (when I\u0026#39;m a hangry beast) it\u0026#39;s not. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI would give this place a try when they\u0026#39;re doing one of those deals on two-person meals, that\u0026#39;s when I think it\u0026#39;s most worth it.","I always love the service, they\u0026#39;re incredibly friendly and the food is very consistent. Really surprised by how good the strawberry shake was. Real strawberries real ice cream. Probably too much for lunch but I really enjoyed it","Food was great, I had the avocado egg rolls and the beet and avocado salad from the skinnylicious menu. \u00a0I made reservations and was seated promptly when I arrived. \u00a0Everyone I encountered was polite and efficient. \u00a0Great experience and just happy I can go out, dine in, and enjoy a great meal."
"I came with low expectations and extremely hungry. This review may be skewed. Forgive me. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe meat was great. The mac n cheese was delicious. The mashed potatoes were good (get it loaded). The cashier girl was super helpful. The food came quick. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNot 5 stars because it ain\u0026#39;t the best I\u0026#39;ve had.

Google: wallaby Orem coupon, and click on the Valpak link. 2 combos + dessert to share for $17. \u00a0you\u0026#39;re welcome mah peeps.","So in case you live under a rock and don\u0026#39;t know the fine quality of chick fil a then you need to get out from under that rock and run to this place. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor some reason almost all fast food joints are dirty and the employees are rude and the food is not that satisfying. Let me just tell you that Chick-fil-A\u0026#39;s business model is the exact opposite. They have friendly workers, the service is always fast and the food is as good as it gets. I\u0026#39;ve tried about everything on their menu and it all deserves 5-stars. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePro tip: try their breakfast and your life will be forever changed. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis location is top notch and will always be a go to for an inexpensive, quality fast meal!","Great food, but overpriced. I got a delicious bowl of white chicken chili, and I would definitely order it again, but $15+ is pretty expensive, and that\u0026#39;s on the cheaper side of the menu. Lighting is pretty dark in the room, and often times there is a wait at this location because it\u0026#39;s a popular place. The cheesecake itself is phenomenal--very rich, it can be split between two people."
"I met up with a friend for dinner at this Wallabys. \u00a0 He suggested this place because it was close to his home and he liked their Lemon Pepper Chicken. \u00a0I got here and it was busy for a weekday evening. \u00a0The line went really quick, though. \u00a0I wanted a little more than him and decided on the 3 Meat Combo for $11.50. \u00a0I got the brisket, beef tri-tip, and the lemon pepper chicken. \u00a0I asked a lot of questions at the time of my purchase. \u00a0How much in ounces I was getting? \u00a0Which part of the chicken? \u00a0How good is the brisket? Yeah, I\u0026#39;m one of those customers that needs to know what\u0026#39;s in the food and how much of it. The cashier was very patient with me, checked with the cooks on the portion sizes, and answered all my questions. \u00a0I got my meal and was shocked with the amount of meat that was on my plate. \u00a0For $11.50, I expected about 3 oz. servings of each meat. \u00a0The cashier even stated that each of my meat servings was about 3 oz. I got a lot more than that and was very pleased. \u00a0My friend even thinks that the cooks hooked it up. \u00a0The brisket was a little dry. I thought that the tri-tip was good and my friend was right, the lemon pepper chicken was the bomb. \u00a0Overall, I expected a lot less from Wallabys based on their Yelp Reviews and price. \u00a0What I got was pretty good BBQ with huge portions. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2017 Yelp Review #105",This location should not be allowed to call themselves a Chick-fil-A. Terrible customer service. Waited 15 minutes for chicken sandwiches. With no explanation volunteered after ten minutes we asked about the delay and we were given a very curt reply if we are waiting on fillets. Spoke to the manager and we were told we could get our money back if we didn\u0026#39;t want to wait. No apology no sorry for the delay or sorry for the lack of communication. The one shining moment was the young lady who processed our refund she was very apologetic and kind. We will never come back to this sorry excuse for a Chick-fil-A.,I ordered a 30 dollar rib eye and the steak was no bigger then my fist.. \u00a0sad. I know it\u0026#39;s \u00a0not a steak place bbt damn!!!! \u00a0\u003cbr\u003eCheesecake was good. \u00a0200 dollars latter. \u00a0BOOM!
I arrived at about 12:45 and the service was quick \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI ordered a Brisket Sanger it was Ok - the bread was dry and fell apart at first bite \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe smashers were not what I hoped for it was warm - not hot mashed potatoes with cheese on top (not even melted) the coleslaw has a lot of mayo and not much flavor. \u00a0I came in wanted to really like this place. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy daughter loved her Brisket and smashes but also said they were cold. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMaybe next time,"Consistently good service and good food! I can never complain. This location is on par with every chik-fil-a I\u0026#39;ve been to. They\u0026#39;re prompt, precise, and polite.",There is always a wait to get seated here. \u00a0The wait staff are never really all with it. \u00a0If you don\u0026#39;t get a booth then your seated in the table area crammed right next to people (very awkward). \u00a0This particular visit the server was working 2 tables and just dragged. \u00a0When food arrived veggies were missing was told it\u0026#39;s a new line cook and he forgot. \u00a0The sauce on the Steak Diane had no flavor and the pile of mashed potatoes were full of the skins and cold not very appetizing. \u00a0The artichoke cheese dip was pretty good and then the free bread is always just ok. \u00a0Overall the prices are expensive the service is always lack luster but I find myself coming back a few times a year hoping it\u0026#39;s going to be a better experience but it\u0026#39;s always just meh.

When something is 5 star, it knocks my socks off. It turns into an obsession. 5 star food becomes the standard to which I compare all other food to. Chick-Fil-A is 5 star through and through. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI go to a Chick-Fil-A, on average, three times a week. That\u0026#39;s no exaggeration, and sometimes I even go more.

It\u0026#39;s not ground up meat, purified, then molded into chicken nugget \u0026#34;shapes.\u0026#34; This is REAL chicken. It stays moist and tender. The breading is just so perfectly seasoned. I love the strips! But the nuggets are incredible, too. Especially paired with the Chick-Fil-A Sauce or Ranch? Holy...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso, their fries. Their waffle fries.

It\u0026#39;s heaven. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHonorable mention also goes to their no fuss Classic Chicken Sandwich. I go classic, always. Just a bun, chicken and pickles.

He went to look for it, but it took him a little longer to found it. That was the third and last disappointment of the night."
Love the Family Meal. \u00a0Pulled Pork and Tri-Tip... MMMmmmm,Was a little dissatisfied with the staff tonight. Seemed to joke around with my order and were not acting very professional. I tried to scan my rewards card but it was too late apparently because the payment was processed and they kind of shrugged it off like oh well. Also dirty tables in the lobby that were not cleaned the whole time we sat down and ate our meal. Not as clean as it usually is.,My friends love this place and I keep going trying to see what they see\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0026#39;m not blind but their food is just marginal in my opinion. \u00a0It\u0026#39;s expensive too and often the wait is unreasonable\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTake me to a great local place any day or time and maybe next time I can convince my friends to explore
"I was really excited to try this place and I don\u0026#39;t think I will return. I ordered the sliced brisket. The brisket came to me chopped, flavorless and cold. The sauces were ok and the only reason I could finish it. I ate the brisket first without to sauce to see what kind of smoke flavor there was. There was hardly any there. Just tasted like cold flavorless meat. So sad.","Never disappoints. It\u0026#39;s Chik-Fil-A... this is a great establishment. Better than the Cougar Eats Im at BYU, they make it greasy and nasty there.","Ordered take out online. I was given a time for pick up and arrived at my designated time. I was the only one waiting for orders at that time. The staff came out and told me it would be a couple more minutes. 35 minutes later.... I got my order.

The waiter was a bro came in clutch with some dope rolls. Because the other one was too doughy but he still a bro and came in clutch.,"THIS PLACE IS AMAZING! I would recommend coming here, for a fast food restaurant this place deserves more then a 5 star! The customer service is amazing and I have never experienced such great employees and the environment of the place is amazing! The employees were super kind and vary friendly! The food was amazing and like nothing you can get anywhere else! Particularly this location is amazing and I always come here! One of my favorite here is there frosted lemonade and it is to die for and the chick-fil-A sauce is amazing! So definitely come for the best fast food there is!!!","I\u0026#39;ve previously visited Cheesecake Factory restaurants in San Francisco and Chicago, and this was my second visit to this Salt Lake City location. \u00a0Unfortunately, I\u0026#39;m pretty sure this will also be my last visit to the Salt Lake City venue. \u00a0The problem with this locale is not the food, but rather it\u0026#39;s the wait. \u00a0And honestly it isn\u0026#39;t even the wait itself. \u00a0No, the real problem are the conditions you endure while waiting. \u00a0Years ago, when this location was first being built, I thought that by Cheesecake Factory standards this was going to be an undersized location, which prediction has entirely come true. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn our most recent visit we arrived just after 4:30 pm (knowing that there would be a wait, we were planning ahead) and once we fought our way through the entrance crowd and waited in line at the reception desk just to put our name in, we were already 15 minutes into an ordeal that I would rather never experience again. \u00a0We were told to check back in an hour, but to expect a 75 minute wait, so as planned we went off to the adjoining mall to kill some time. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAn hour later, as instructed, we returned and somehow is seemed as though the sardine-packed crowd had doubled in size, though nonetheless managed to squeeze into the cramped waiting area. \u00a0We checked in again and we were told it would be another 20 minutes (so now the prediction is an 80 minute wait, which would have been just lovely in retrospect). \u00a0Eighty minutes came and went, as did any semblance of personal space or dignity our foursome once had. \u00a0Honestly, McDonalds was sounding like a world class option at that point--but we survived so long that we couldn\u0026#39;t give up. \u00a0Surrender was simply not an option. \u00a0Well, because this review is threatening to become about as long as our restaurant wait, I\u0026#39;ll just skip ahead and reveal that it took nearly two hours to finally be seated.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThen, another 15 minutes passed before bread was delivered to our table--I literally thought my 9 year old was going to pass out from hunger. \u00a0After ordering, another 30 minutes passed before our entrees arrived. \u00a0After then ravenously scarfing down our meals, our dinner ordeal finally ended around 8:30 pm--yep, FOUR hours invested in dinner.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlthough the Cheesecake Factory has decent food, and a huge variety of it, the food is simply not good enough to warrant this kind of self-inflicted food deprivation and close-quarters, standing room only high endurance waiting. \u00a0In fact, the ONLY reason we came on this occasion is that over the past 2 years we had collected FIVE Cheesecake Factory gift cards and decided it was finally time to get our free meal. \u00a0In the end, it was a mistake. \u00a0I am pretty much convinced that anyone that gives you a Cheesecake Factory gift card in Utah either (1) doesn\u0026#39;t really like you very much, or (2) hopes you have travel plans that include a Cheesecake Factory location elsewhere. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAbsent the inexcusable wait and horrendous herded cattle/mosh pit waiting conditions, I\u0026#39;d probably rate this location a 3-star joint based on the food. \u00a0But, alas, waiting is the name of the game here, so 1-star is all this location deserves. \u00a0Please trust me on this--there are far better restaurant choices, with much better food, and many of such places even participate in the cutting edge 1970s practice of taking reservations! \u00a0Now, THERE\u0026#39;s an idea for you, Cheesecake Factory. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe will not be back--no matter how many gift cards may befall us."
"Wow! Delicious food and so much that I could only eat half of my dinner. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI ordered beef brisket and smashed potatoes with grated cheese. Awesome. My meal also came with a roll, drink and coleslaw. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy husband loved their ribs and baked beans.","Food \u0026amp; everything was just like other Chicfila\u0026#39; only thing was the bathroom was kinda gross, they can\u0026#39;t control everything but have been to cleaner bathrooms at other locations","This restaurant visit was the result of not being able to decide a type of food we were craving- and they do have a vast amount of menu items. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003eParking can get crazy on weekends, Thursday evening on this occasion it wasn\u0026#39;t too bad, I don\u0026#39;t mind the walk. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003eThe wait time was allegedly 25-30 min (the hostess said it was more like 25). So we waited and waited. \u00a0I know it surely could\u0026#39;ve been worse, but I don\u0026#39;t feel like the waiting area set up is that great. \u00a0People crammed into a space, not really room for groups of 4+people. \u00a0I should\u0026#39;ve got on the waitlist or made a reservation and seen if there was a difference in wait time. \u00a0Next time I will be doing that. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003eSo when we finally were seated it was between two large groups of 6+ people, and we could barely hear each other talk. \u00a0The lights are basically non-existent and I\u0026#39;d suggest looking at your menu with a flashlight. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003eOur waitress, Elaine N., saved this experience as she was attentive, polite, and friendly enough to make some menu suggestions and kept our drinks full. \u00a0Service in general was quick. \u003cbr\u003eThe food wasn\u0026#39;t bad, but it wasn\u0026#39;t like a blown mind experience. \u00a0I had a Parmesan and herb crusted chicken, green beans, and mashed potatoes. \u00a0My husband had some sort of crispy chicken with honey sauce and mashed potatoes. \u00a0The masked potatoes were the highlight of the meal besides the complimentary bread. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003eThe workers seem overworked, on more than one occasion I saw an exasperated expression on their faces. \u003cbr\u003eOverall feeling is that I don\u0026#39;t really want to go back, it is so cramped, even for a \u0026#39;special occasion\u0026#39; I would want to actually be able to talk to whoever I was with. \u00a0You can get kind of comfort food elsewhere for a better price."
"Wallaby\u0026#39;s is the bomb! Everything is so good! Australian BBQ at its best. I love the beef brisket, it\u0026#39;s soft and flavorful. The garlic smashers mashed potatoes are yummy and cucumber salad. The side salad is really good too with their ranch. My husband loves the tri tip steak. They have three different bbq sauces to choose from, zesty, raspberry and original. All three are very tasty. You can\u0026#39;t go wrong with anything you order at wallaby\u0026#39;s. Very good Oreo brownies with vanilla ice cream for dessert.",There\u0026#39;s an expected experience when you go into a Chick-FIL-A or the drive through and this location has it down pat! \u00a0I\u0026#39;ve never felt frustrated waiting because they have at least two or three people working to get your order and get your food. \u00a0And the food is why we go there as often as possible. Yes I\u0026#39;ll be back again soon.,Hands down my favorite restaurant. Go there every year for special occasions. I get something different every time and there is nothing on their menu that isn\u0026#39;t delicious. It\u0026#39;s just one of those solid places that really knows what they\u0026#39;re doing!
"I love Wallaby\u0026#39;s! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0026#39;ve been several times. Their ribs literally fall off the bone. I\u0026#39;ve also had them cater for an event at BYU. They were very easy to work with, it was apparently the best food we\u0026#39;ve had at an event in the Advertising Program.",One of the best options at Chick-fil-A is the breakfast bowl. It is very very good. I highly recommend it. The only problem is the size I could literally eat three of them and I am not a big eater I recommend that Chick-fil-A increase the size and scale back the price of the breakfast bowl. I would go there much more often for breakfast if they did.,The Cajun Chicken Littles are the best chicken strips you can buy. The Red Velvet Cheesecake is incredible.
Good basic bbq choices. There is a large comfy dining area and a semi -private room you can use for large groups. Their sweet and wild salad is a great side choice. They will make it for you even though it is no longer listed on the menu.,"Chick-fil-A is fantastic and this location is no exception. The service is wonderful, all of the employees are kind and helpful. The only reason that I\u0026#39;m giving it four stars instead of five is because the lemonade tasted weird. Also, after I was done eating I began to have a headache and feel bad. But, this location lives up to the glory of Chick-fil-A for sure!",I still feel like tHey are a little over priced but then again... that cheesecake!! The raspberry and Oreo are Faves of ours!
"I used to love Wallabys when they were in Lindon (maybe it was North Orem). I always ate a simple meal - pork sanger with potato salad. Yesterday I had some time to kill and noticed Wallabys was now on center street, pretty close to where I work, so I thought I would give it a shot.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am guessing it is under new management or at least has a new chef - the experience was nothing like the Wallabys I used to beg coworkers to go to. The first signs that this wasn\u0026#39;t the same Wallabys came when I was ordering - I asked for potato salad - \u0026#34;we don\u0026#39;t have that.\u0026#34; It\u0026#39;s possible I was the only one who liked it, so I can\u0026#39;t fault them for that, but back in the day they had the best potato salad.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOh well, stuff changes - fine, I\u0026#39;ll get the fries that come with the sandwich. When my food finally came out (around 15 mins - seemed like a long time considering nobody else was in the restaurant yet they had a full kitchen) I was disappointed. The bread the sandwich was on wasn\u0026#39;t good at all, the meat itself was nothing like the tender, delicious pork they had before and the french fries were horrible. They tasted like the kind you freeze.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI contemplated giving them 2 stars instead of 1 just because they had diet mt. dew in the drink machine, but the food was bad enough that I won\u0026#39;t be going back even for the Mt. Dew. It\u0026#39;s sad to see a restaurant that used to be so good slide so far. In addition to the overall disappointing experience it was also expensive. Too bad...","Bomb food, bomb service, I could legitimately put chick-fil-a sauce on all my food ever. It\u0026#39;s kind of become fun to see how many times they respond with, \u0026#34;my pleasure.\u0026#34; Like, they always remember. Well-trained, highly efficient restaurant and people.","Food is always great. Service is always a hit and miss. \u003cbr\u003eWe\u0026#39;ve had some great waiters and we\u0026#39;ve had a waitress who\u0026#39;s messed up our order and gave us attitude, for some reason.\u003cbr\u003eMeals are about $15-$20 on average. Their lower calorie menu is actually yummy, their pastas are delicious, and of course they have the greatest cheesecake (which are about $10 per slice.) \u003cbr\u003eAtmosphere complaints from my grandma: It\u0026#39;s very loud and it\u0026#39;s too dark (she can\u0026#39;t read the menu and she feels like she can\u0026#39;t see the person sitting across from her.)"
"Is \u0026#34;Australian BBQ\u0026#34; really a thing, as in its cuisine type? I can\u0026#39;t imagine, but I suppose it\u0026#39;s possible. Maybe one day I\u0026#39;ll recruit some actual Australians and rope them into coming here to find out how authentic it is...but most probably I won\u0026#39;t. I also really hesitate to call this BBQ, even if they claim it, since it really just isn\u0026#39;t quite that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs you have no doubt guessed, this is a moderately Australian-themed restaurant that seems to be want to be a BBQ joint, with one sign proclaiming it to be the best in town (very original, no one ever does that). In this case, it most definitely is not and also reinforces the thought that if you have to be the one laying superlatives on your own head, they\u0026#39;re most probably not true. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLots of different BBQ sauces here...the Tasmanian Devil one was acceptable, the rest much less so. The Honey-Habanero pork had plenty of the first, none detectable of the second and was very reminiscent of Lloyd\u0026#39;s. I asked for, but didn\u0026#39;t actually get a rib to try, so not sure how that was. I also was charged twice for a drink, but it\u0026#39;s not the end of the world, given how unlikely a return by me is. Staff was otherwise friendly.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI went with the surf and turf because I\u0026#39;m stupid and foods with cutesy names like \u0026#34;shrimp on the barbie\u0026#34; I\u0026#39;m evidently incapable of resisting. The steak was an absurd travesty, tough, chewy (held the BBQ sauce ok, though the bottles of that came out through the dumbest cap delivery system I\u0026#39;ve yet seen) and it\u0026#39;s hard to imagine anyone finding that good. \u0026#34;Fresh\u0026#34; veggies were steamed halfway to oblivion and chock full of onions (WTFF) and the actual shrimps were mostly ok, though flavor was a bit light. You inexplicably do not get served silverware, though and have to retrieve that yourself.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe best thing was the rice and beans side, which was basic black beans and white rice and that should probably tell you all you really need to know. They did also have Diet Mt. Dew on tap, good on them there. Inside is huge, lots of space for lots of people and despite this being a rarity, me coming during an actual peak lunchtime, it never got to above 40% capacity and I may be erring on the generous side here...it\u0026#39;s nice and new and shiny and mostly empty and after that experience, I know why. I don\u0026#39;t really care about all the silly pseudo-Aussie stuff, like crocodile heads on the shelves and so on, as long as the food delivers. Here it missed pretty considerably. When I shell out $18 for lunch and still leave kinda hungry, someone is doing something wrong. Won\u0026#39;t be me again...at least not here.","If I could go back in time I would have my wedding dinner here. That\u0026#39;s how good this place is. I wish I could respond to bad ratings the same way Gordon Ramsey responds to people with peasant palates. Aka \u0026#34;get the f\u0026amp;\u20ac\u00a3 out of my kitchen\u0026#34;. Chic-fil-A is a sacred place and shouldn\u0026#39;t be desecrated by people who\u0026#39;s palate would rather eat at any fast food chain over Chic-fil-A. Seriously though, f\u0026amp;\u20ac\u00a3 all of the haters.","Came to this location for an early dinner with the family, and since I reserved a table online thru Yelp reservation, we walked in, and got seated within 10 minutes - while the rest of the walk ins had like 1.5 to 2 hours wait, at 4:45pm on a weeknight! \u00a0It\u0026#39;s crazy how PACKED this place is, on a weeknight, and on an early dinner time too. \u00a0We have had the privilege to sit in Alex\u0026#39;s section, and Alex was personable, friendly, and just really easy to chat with! \u00a0He happily fulfilled our wishes of never ending servings of the brown bread, with a plethora of butter plates each time! \u00a0Ordered the shrimp scampi plate, while hubby ordered his all time favorite, Chicken Louisiana pasta. \u00a0Kids ordered chicken tenders, fries, and mac n\u0026#39;cheese. \u00a0It was a fantastic dinner and ended it with our favorite Tuxedo cheesecake (you can NEVER go wrong with this choice). \u00a0I did order the strawberry shortcake but they changed how they serve the cake now. \u00a0It used to be one big piece and then a mound of vanilla ice cream, then fresh strawberries on top. \u00a0Now they have 4 small pieces of muffin cake, then ice cream on each one, then strawberries. \u00a0The cake tastes different now, more like a biscuit instead of a pound cake taste. \u00a0Too bad they changed it - the original one tasted way better!"
"I went back today for the 3rd time after the Monday night rush and had a much nicer experience. The floors were looking a lot better and the tables were being cleaned promptly, which makes it so much less stressful of an experience. The food was great as usual. \u00a0I love the desserts and the beef. Well done!","One of our family\u0026#39;s all time favorite. \u00a0If the drive through line is long, you can get your food faster by ordering through the app and having your food brought to you curbside.",Garbage restaurant. They make you wear a mask for 10 seconds while they walk you to your seat. Then those pricks asked my pregnant wife to \u0026#34;cover your full face\u0026#34; on this 10 second journey. This enforcement is absolute bull. I will never visit this place again. It\u0026#39;s full of virtue signaling pricks. I hate this place.
Wallaby\u0026#39;s is SO GOOD. Highly recommend their pulled pork sandwich or their Aussie burger. Ingredients are high quality and fresh and the flavor is delicious!,Can never go wrong with this place. Always tender and juicy chicken.

I truly cannot believe that I was getting served instant potatoes. The stake was \u00a0warm but over cooked. The shrimp was cold! I loved the roll and the salad was fresh. I\u0026#39;m still in shock over the instant potatoes!,Had Chick-fil-A breakfast for the first time and it was really good! The two girls that helped us in the drive-thru were very friendly and polite and when I asked for more vanilla flavor for my coffee they were very nice and got me more.,"Disappointed. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eArrived about 5:30pm on a Sunday. Got seated and the waitress informed us of no bread.Every trip to CF, we always look forward to the hot bread and butter. We love eating it with our Pasta. Then I ordered a Buffalo Blast and that dish was served BURNT! It was fried too long that the batter was turned dark and you can smell the overcooked oil. Disgusting. The kitchen and staff should take pride in their work and presentation. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWon\u0026#39;t be visiting anytime soon. Nope!"
"Wallabys is an Australian themed BBQ restaurant\u003cbr\u003ein which you order at the counter. \u00a0They have\u003cbr\u003emany tables and booths if you wish to eat in.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile we were studying the menu board on the wall\u003cbr\u003ethe cashier approached us and offered to explain\u003cbr\u003ethe menu and answer our questions since this was\u003cbr\u003eour first visit. \u00a0She made us feel very welcome\u003cbr\u003eand definitely made a good impression. \u00a0She was\u003cbr\u003enot wearing a name tag but the receipt said\u003cbr\u003eAlyssa.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThey had 9 or 10 varieties of meat.\u003cbr\u003ePrices for most dishes were in the $9 to $13 range,\u003cbr\u003eand included two sides.\u003cbr\u003eAfter you pay they bring your order to the table.\u003cbr\u003eBBQ sauces, condiments, and drinks are self-serve.\u003cbr\u003eI recommend the Pomegranate Limeade.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe food is delicious, the staff is great,\u003cbr\u003eand the prices are reasonable.\u003cbr\u003eI highly recommend this restaurant.","Fresh food, blazing fast service.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0026#39;ve been there twice since they opened. The first time they had a double drive through line that wrapped around to the front of the store. I was hesitant but pulled into the line. I was amazed that I had my food ordered and was driving away in under 10 minutes. The 2nd time I went the double line was just barely sticking out of the drive through area and I was out in less than 5 minutes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe food is Chick Fil A. It\u0026#39;s not fair for me to leave a review about the food because its fast food and you shouldn\u0026#39;t expect anything more. With that said this location is a great example of what fast food should be. Fast, hot, fresh, and everyone that has served me has done it with a huge smile and attitude that showed that they wanted to be there and they apprecated me being there. I even caught a guy taking out the garbage while I was waiting in the drive through and he waved and asked how my day was while he walked by. Big thumbs up to the management for hiring great people.","I placed an order via Door Dash. \u00a0Food came hot and ready in a timely manner. \u00a0Part of my order was fried food stuffed with chicken and several of the pieces didn\u0026#39;t have any meat in them so it was just fried batter. \u00a0I love CF and have never had this problem, but when I saw this I definitely felt like I overpaid because I didn\u0026#39;t eat that food."
"From Ca. And thank goodness for this place! We had dinner here for 12 people 2 nights in a row. Great staff, service and quality food for price especially.","Went on a date here last night. I don\u0026#39;t usual write reviews, but everyone working here was on point, super friendly girl talking through the drive through, even though it was packed we still got through pretty fast, the guy that was at the window threw away some of our garbage even though he wasn\u0026#39;t suppose to, and they all worked fast with a smile. Five stars for impressing my date with the waffle cut fries and freshly squeezed lemonade ;) \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eP.S. can we change the two pickles on the number 1 to three or four pickles?","Our waiter was very attentive and I actually like that they have such a large menu.

I liked everything I ordered.\u003cbr\u003eNuestro camarero era muy atento y en realidad me gusta que tienen un gran men\u00fa.

This place is really good but there are a few things that are a must. The smashers (mashed potatoes) are awesome and you have to get a few warm rolls with the cinnamon butter. The pork was moist and tender and I loved bumping just the right amount of BBQ sauce over it. I will be back.....Often.,"This place has quality chicken for being a fast food joint. And I may get tarred and feathered for this, but I\u0026#39;d rather go here over Popeyes any day of the week. The staff is friendly and the food is fresh and fast. I recommend the chicken strips with Polynesian sauce. And be sure to wash it down with one of their delicious strawberry shakes. They also seem to be somewhat health conscious, as instead of a side of fries you can order a fruit cup among other things. The fruit was good and tasted fresh. Not one bit of it tasted bitter. Also, their lemonade however, was on the bitter side, but that\u0026#39;s just how I like it so it tasted great to me.","Absolutely love this location. \u00a0The staff really cares. \u00a0We had a mix up with a yelp reservation and the opening manager called me personally to take care of us. \u00a0Our waiter is a ten year veteran of the brand and provides 5 diamond service. \u00a0Made for a very special brunch with loved ones. \u00a0Morning, noon or night still have to go with the Bang Bang chicken and shrimp. \u00a0 Hard to believe we have been able to enjoy Cheesecake Factory in Utah for a decade. \u00a0So grateful the staff and management team stay true to brand standards."
Thought it was very good. Nice environment too. Like the fact that you add the BBQ sauce of your choice to the meats. I enjoyed a combo of the Zesty sauce and Sweet and Spicy. The smashers were great... a fully loaded baked potato without the work. \u00a0My brisket was very tender and flavorful. My hubby\u0026#39;s pulled pork was delicious too! Don\u0026#39;t forget the wonderful rolls (Reminded me of Grandy\u0026#39;s ones in TX) and definitely request the cinnamon butter for them!!!,"Let me just start by saying I\u0026#39;m not a fan of fast food. I wish CFA didn\u0026#39;t qualify as fast food, but it does. And I love it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is Provo\u0026#39;s newest location, just opened earlier this month. Located on the corner of a very busy intersection where real life and BYU converge, don\u0026#39;t even attempt to come here around the weekday lunch hour. It\u0026#39;s mayhem at this point. I\u0026#39;ve kept my lunchtime visits to before 11:30am or after 1:30pm, and it\u0026#39;s been fine. Our last visit was a Friday evening around 7:30pm and the place was insane. They handled the inside crowd very well, and the line went fast considering the 30-some people in it at pretty much all times. Staffers were delivering food to the tables without the benefit of table tent numbers. Still not sure how they did that. But we were impressed.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis location has a play room for the kiddos, and boy did they ever take advantage of it when we were there. It\u0026#39;s nice to have a place to allow the littles to release their abounding energy, but I was wishing there was a one-way lock on the door to keep them in there. Don\u0026#39;t judge me - it\u0026#39;s just that kids have a tendency to race back and forth between the dining room and the play room...and when there\u0026#39;s a crowd, it\u0026#39;s just really irritating when parents pay no attention to what their kids are doing (ie. tripping people carrying food trays, screetching, running and landing on the tables of strangers, the list goes on...). But, this is the price you pay eating anywhere this close to BYU parent-student housing. Which is why we\u0026#39;ll rarely eat-in anymore.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn to the food. I have always been impressed that CFA is very likely alone in the WYSIWYG category for fast food joints. The beautifully advertised sandwiches and salads actually look like they do when you get them, surprisingly. My recent favorite is the Chargrilled Chicken Sandwich, from its gorgeous fresh green leaf lettuce to the tomato that doesn\u0026#39;t look like its been on chemo. The chicken breast is flavorful and juicy. The sauces are delicious - particularly the new one: Honey Roasted BBQ - WHAT?!?! Yes. I\u0026#39;ve squeezed the life out of this packet to get that last pinhead-sized bit. If you don\u0026#39;t get at least one packet of this, ask for it. It\u0026#39;s not yet on the condiment bar.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOther menu favorites for me are the their chicken nuggets. They\u0026#39;re just phenomenal, and made from actual chicken breast. Unlike other fast food chicken nuggets, you don\u0026#39;t bite into a CFA nugget only to see anything but lean chicken meat. It\u0026#39;s solid. And the dipping sauces are delicious; my favorite being the Polynesian (CFA\u0026#39;s version of sweet and sour). The others are really tasty, too.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow, here\u0026#39;s a new discovery for me at CFA - the Diet Lemonade. I\u0026#39;ve been a longtime fan of their regular lemonade. It\u0026#39;s as good as Hot Dog on a Stick\u0026#39;s famous lemonade. But I\u0026#39;ve not tried the Diet until recently, thinking it would suck. I was shocked to find out that it doesn\u0026#39;t! It\u0026#39;s just as delicious as the regular, and I can\u0026#39;t believe it took me this long to find that out. It\u0026#39;s what I\u0026#39;ll order from now on. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love Chick-fil-A so much that I don\u0026#39;t even care that they\u0026#39;re not open on Sundays. I wish they were, and would normally deduct a star for it. But, I am willing to forgive because they have soothed my soul with their stellar service and deliciously and relatively healthy food.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0026#39;m a big fan. BIG.",Service was amazing and the food was delicious. Reservation preferred because walk ins had to wait almost two hours
We came here close to closing. So maybe that \u00a0is why it was so bad. \u00a0The brisket was dry and much more like a pot roast. The beans and rice were crunchy. It was like they were scraped from the bottom of the pan. And the tri tip steak my son had tasted like the grill. Everything was dry and there\u0026#39;s not even a hint of smoke flavor. \u00a0Bbq sauce doesn\u0026#39;t help.,"I\u0026#39;m not a huge fan of fast food, but I do like chick-fil-a. I am also excited that they are going to (eventually) start using chicken without antibiotics. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis location is new. I have usually gone during lunch hours and it gets crowded fast. There are a good amount of tables inside and I have usually been able to find something.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe employees are super friendly and helpful. Also, the owner has always been very friendly and helpful as well. He checks in on the customers and asks if he can help with anything. Great customer service.","The service was prompt and nice, but that\u0026#39;s where the good times ended. This is a standard CF, nothing special. Usual mall location so I wound up here after taking an Uber the day before a conference to grab a pair of shoes at the mall. The local spot I wanted was already closed (at 8:30) so I chose CF. The waiter was okay but the kitchen and management leave a lot to be desired.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI ordered the French onion soup and, I kid you not, it was ROOM TEMPERATURE and served with unmelted SHREDDED Parmesan cheese just floating around at the bottom. In short, TERRIBLE.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThen I decided the kitchen might not be up to standards so I ordered the tamale cake appetizer and the avocado egg rolls because they\u0026#39;re always good, right? It didn\u0026#39;t seem like I ordered anything that could be ruined; I was wrong. The egg rolls were undercooked too ... I don\u0026#39;t know how this is possible as they\u0026#39;re all frozen, the fryers should be kept on the same temp and they should be cooked for a standard period of time. Sigh. I was OVER it. I\u0026#39;d just gotten off a 6 hour flight and was ready for bed so I asked for them to go. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNot only did the manager fail to check on me EVEN ONCE, they also didn\u0026#39;t comp the soup-- of which I had one bite--and the egg rolls were raw again and inedible and I went to bed pissed and hungry $60 later. I loved my mango key lime cheesecake though. That\u0026#39;s seriously in the top 2 cheesecakes I\u0026#39;ve ever had.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever this visit was a complete failure."
"Great non-chain choice. \u00a0The pulled pork and tri tip were great. \u00a0Smashed potatoes were delicious. \u00a0Rolls with cinnamon honey butter were also tasty. \u00a0Kids had the MacNCheese, Hot Dog, and grilled cheese. \u00a0All were great. \u00a0Will definitely go back.","This is just a classy restaurant chain... minus the anti gay marriage view. But look I am for gay marriage and I still think it deserves a 4 star! I go for food not for politics! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThey have very happy workers as they do at every location. Very flirty if its a member of the opposite sex, and very helpful if its the same sex. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll of their food is good quality... a little on the expensive side.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e(I recently purchased their sauces so I don\u0026#39;t have to pay 6 dollars for a chicken sandwich, I can make my own for much less.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also dont like being around kids... so I avoid this place, because it seems that everyone in provo have at least 4-200 offspring.

Everything here is delicious!
"Food was great. We had 6 kids and 4 adults at our table, and didn\u0026#39;t feel embarrassed about the loud/craziness of our group. We took home a bunch of leftovers, so if you\u0026#39;re into sharing an entree, this is a place where you can do that and not go home hungry. Or get the sampler, and eat the leftovers tomorrow.",So delicious. Their breakfast burrito bowl is great and so is their market salad. They offer gluten free options that still taste wonderful.,A mask is required. I luckily had two so my husband and I were ok. The blond girl at the check in desk (Fashion Place Mall) was extremely rude. The food was ok. We got the bread and butter and the butter was used!!! The food was not a good as usual but ok.
"We were taking my niece and her fiance to dinner and she chose Wallabys. I perused the menu before we went and thought it looked great. The cashiers were very friendly and helpful. After we sat down, we were pleasantly surprised at how fast our food came. It could have been delicious. Our main issue was the food was lukewarm at best, and my \u0026#34;smashers\u0026#34; were barely warm and tasted like they had been sitting for quite a while. The ribs would have been great, fall off the bone tender and moist, but again, barely warm. Same with the BBQ chicken. The coleslaw and cucumber salad were very good, but they are supposed to be cold! The desserts were quite good, bread pudding and berry cobbler, with high-quality ice cream. We don\u0026#39;t regret going, but prob won\u0026#39;t go again. The prices were reasonable for the amount of food, but we wish it lived up to its potential!","It\u0026#39;s chick fil a, so it always deserves a high score. The fries are so good. Chicken is fresh tasting and the lemonade is so good. The employees are always so nice at this location. I wish they would bring back their old cole slaw. It was my fav side item, besides fries. :( I liked how creamy their cole slaw was.","Been here multiple times with my wife. Their cheesecake lives up to their name, as does the quality of most of their food. The biggest problem is that they are waaaaaay overpriced. Just went there two days ago for my wife\u0026#39;s birthday because they finally opened after the whole COVID-19 crap. I got a 3 pieces of silver-dollar sized pieces of steak in a sauce with mushrooms, 3 pieces of shrimp with some sauce and no pasta (they called this \u0026#34;shrimp scampi\u0026#34; with no pasta) and some mashed potatoes. Between my meal, my wife\u0026#39;s and two pieces of cheesecake with water to drink, we ended up spending $113. Good food, but not for the price or straight-faced blah service we got. If you\u0026#39;re wanting to fee fancy, go somewhere else. If you want great cheesecake to go, by all means stop by."
First time over here at Wallabys Stakehouse! My order was the Melbourne Burger and their Bundaberg Root beer. The burger came with regular condiments and a cooked egg with slice of pineapple. It was great and the fries were excellent with there seasoned fry sauce. This meal was so great it turned our table discussion into a life discussion of our friend telling us how she friend zoned the guy at her apartment. Of course we tried to help out the \u0026#34;Provo All Star\u0026#34; but unfortunately he may not be saved from his demise. Will come back for the food and culture.,Taste the bigotry! \u00a0how ever good people think your fast food sandwich is it\u0026#39;s still just garbage food..,"Out of all the times we have come to Cheesecake Factory,tonight\u0026#39;s service was second to none. And I\u0026#39;m not one to be overly impressed by service from a restaurant chain. Max was the name of our serve. Not only was he attentive, but his social skIlls and professional yet friendly approach made our evening very enjoyable!! If you get lucky enough to receive Max as your waiter, you\u0026#39;ll be assured to receive a 5 star service.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe only reason I\u0026#39;m giving this review a 4 star is because we tried the reservation feature through the yelp app. We showed up not more than 3-5 minutes late due to a accident on the freeway, and they had already given our table away causing us to wait another 10 minutes before being seated. The hostess was very polite and apologized. I asked her if this was normal occurrence for reservations through the yelp app and she said no."
"I do not usually eat BBQ, maybe once a year. \u00a0Bam Bams was closer to my house but closed. \u00a0I went yesterday the day after Xmas. \u00a0 It was dead as can be which can usually be a bad sign however based of yelp ratings (bad idea) I said why not; well let me tell you why not the food was def not fresh or warm. \u00a0It was cold to the touch. \u00a0My wife ordered 1 meat 2 sides so did I. \u00a0She got chicken I went with the recommendation of the brisket which did not look like that picture but more like advertisement for dog food. \u00a0The edges of my brisket were so hard and burnt the rest of it was so dried out you could tell looking at it that it was not edible. \u00a0We tried one bite of each side 1 bite of our meat and maybe a bite of the roll. \u00a0The best part was the Pepsi. \u00a0I should of asked for my money back. \u00a0The managers or employees didn\u0026#39;t ask why we weren\u0026#39;t eating or food or acted like they cared. \u00a0I paid nearly $30 bucks for both plates and 2 drinks with a tip and literally only took 3 bites each. \u00a0I will never ever eat here again. \u00a0I should of flushed $30 down the toilet instead. \u00a0Unless they can reach out to me and make it right I wouldn\u0026#39;t come back unless they refund my meals and show me they have real fresh food and great customer service.","The food came out well as usual. The service was OK, nothing special. The only reason I\u0026#39;m not a fan of this location is the lines....it took seriously like 20 minutes in the drive thru today! It was insanity. Definitely only good when there is no line.","This place is a great place but with one caveat; clear your schedule this is a place you won\u0026#39;t get through quickly. \u00a0It\u0026#39;s super efficient, but crazy busy. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0026#39;s worth it!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMac \u0026amp;Cheese Burger\u003cbr\u003eThis delectable goodness is totally worth it. \u00a0You may be thinking it sounds like a child would buy this... well I\u0026#39;m that adult child that loves this savory meal.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSide salad\u003cbr\u003eI had too when you see the calories right there in front of you, you can\u0026#39;t justify the fries, but this salad was amazing! \u00a0No joke way better than expected for a simple garden salad.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCelebration Cheesecake\u003cbr\u003eYes the kid inside me loves sprinkles and cake so add both of those elements to cheesecake and I\u0026#39;m sold!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI mentioned the long wait, but the mall is right next door so we spent our hour shopping, came back and in a few minutes were seated and ready to go. \u00a0Food came so quickly and our server was awesome!"
"We enjoyed our second meal now at the Orem Wallabys and both times the food was fantastic and the service was even better. Customer service is a lost art that most businesses don\u0026#39;t have, however it is clear that that is not the case with Wallabys! They are so friendly and make sure to treat you as a great customer. Thanks for the fantastic service and care Rylee!!! \u003cbr\u003eWe\u0026#39;ll be back again.

I got the BBQ chipotle chicken with a green salad and fries. The chicken was good. I thought the fries where just blah! The ranch dressing was good and I loved the rolls. My kids liked the mac n cheese,Their food and service are always above and beyond what I expect to receive. Awesome!!,"The food is always good and the portions are big. I always get the Louisiana Pasta, southwestern egg rolls, and the Tiramisu. There is almost always a wait at the door so I recommend reservations on holidays and peak times."
"I went there for my birthday dinner with my wife and her parents. There were several major things wrong with my visit on 3/28/16:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1. They were out of pulled pork AND brisket (seemed like about half of their menu items)\u003cbr\u003e2. There were about 5 of the 8 booths that were available, but EVERY SINGLE AVAILABLE BOOTH was dirty, like no one had bussed these tables in the last hour or two. \u003cbr\u003e*Note- it was NOT busy at all when we went in. There were 6 employees I could see in the kitchen, and only about 2 customers in line to serve. I was severely unimpressed.\u003cbr\u003e3. There was food on the floors that hadn\u0026#39;t been cleaned up (for probably the same amount of time that the tables had stayed dirty.\u003cbr\u003e4. No paper towels in the men\u0026#39;s bathroom.\u003cbr\u003e5. Food was pretty good, but nothing exceptional.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI loved Wallaby\u0026#39;s when they were in their old location (Lindon?). My first date with my now-wife was there. But if this is what I can expect, I won\u0026#39;t be returning.","I honestly love chik filas food especially their chicken minis at breakfast, but this morning we were in line at the drive through at 10:29 for breakfast and by the time we got to order it was 10:31 and they wouldn\u0026#39;t let us order breakfast. I just don\u0026#39;t get that. That is super rude customer service!!!! As much as I love their food I don\u0026#39;t ever wanna go back because of this.",Food was good but the waitress wasn\u0026#39;t good at all. Forgot to put down orders and couldn\u0026#39;t remember anything
"The food was okay, but the service totally killed it for me. My husband and I needed a small meal before going to the movies so we thought we\u0026#39;d share a Smokehouse Meal. We ordered the brisket with smashers and macaroni and cheese and a roll was included. When our meal was delivered to our table they gave us tri-tip steak instead of brisket. I told the girl who delivered our meal that we ordered brisket, but she just walked away!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe had our baby with us and he was hungry so my husband started feeding him mashed potatoes while I went up to the counter to get the order straightened out. I had to wait in line because a few other customers had come in. While I was at the counter my husband had another employee walk by and he got her attention. She took our whole plate that had everything on it, including the mashed potatoes that we were feeding our baby, to the back to fix our order. Now I\u0026#39;m not the type to try and get free food and I\u0026#39;m grateful this employee was fixing our order, but she took the whole plate away leaving us with nothing [to feed our baby]! A few minutes later she came back with our same plate, but you could see where the meat had been slopped off/on again. We started eating because we were starving, but by then the mashed potatoes were cold! At that point I was sick of trying to get things fixed and we just ate cold potatoes. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOk, so on to the actual food! The macaroni and cheese was totally delicious! Aside from being cold, the mashed potatoes, or smashers add they call them, weren\u0026#39;t very good. They were very dry and tasted like they weren\u0026#39;t made with butter. Or maybe without milk? Two things that are definitely a requirement when it comes to mashed potatoes! The roll was cooked to perfection and had just the right amount of doughy-ness to it. The brisket was sub-par, but luckily they had 6 different kinds of BBQ sauce to give it some zing. It was plenty moist, but it wasn\u0026#39;t very flavorful and for a restaurant that calls themselves a \u0026#34;Smokehouse\u0026#34; one just expects more. My sister and her kids were there with us and they let us try their ribs, pulled pork and chicken. I couldn\u0026#39;t tasted difference between either one, they were both dry and too salty. The ribs were good though! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe restaurant was clean and decorated nicely. There were a few other couples there as well as a small family. We went around 6 PM on a Tuesday.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLike others have commented, I too thought this was the same Wallaby\u0026#39;s that used to be in Lindon. I don\u0026#39;t remember exactly what I ordered there, but I remember they had a delicious wrap. I\u0026#39;d been telling my husband about it on the way, but they don\u0026#39;t have any wraps on the menu. I much preferred the old Wallaby\u0026#39;s. We won\u0026#39;t be returning due to service, as there are plenty of other places with better BBQ.","Chick-fil-a has been one of my favorite restaurants for years now. Finally we have an eating establishment that does fast food right. I make sure to stop on by for some of their world famous, mouth watering, succulent chicken about 2-3 times a week. Whether it be the chicken sandwiches, waffle fries, or frosted lemonades; it will always be a \u0026#34;pleasure\u0026#34; to grab a quick bite to eat at the chick fil a.","Visited this establishment for the umpteenth time and really had a great experience this visit! \u00a0I used the Yelp reservation feature (A GREAT feature by the way) and made reservations for four for 8:00 PM to beat the Saturday evening stampede. \u00a0We actually arrived ~15 minutes early and the table was waiting for us, so we sat right down and we\u0026#39;re waited on by \u0026#34;Gabby.\u0026#34;\u003cbr\u003eThe family and I ordered various adult beverages, two appetizers, the breads and butter they always serve, two appetizers, and two desserts (cheesecake, natch.) \u00a0Overall, the experience was excellent hampered by just two issues:\u003cbr\u003e1. \u00a0The always-annoying all-treble/no-bass and way too loud pop music being piped in (which was addressed my management after we asked Gabby to ask the manager to turn it down a bit...and they did!)\u003cbr\u003e2. \u00a0Late arrival of our main course...to the tune of 60 minutes after the point we ordered the meal. \u00a0Yikes! \u00a0Thank God we had the appetizers!\u003cbr\u003eGabby actually brought this to the attention of the managers...which I presume were working overtime to keep the kitchen flow moving...but it didn\u0026#39;t help our situation much. \u00a0In fact, at least two local tables were served their main course ahead of us even after arriving there 10-20 minutes after we were seated! \u00a0Probably \u0026#34;Just Another Saturday Night at TCF,\u0026#34; I guess.\u003cbr\u003eRegardless, at the suggestion of one of our foursome, the kitchen manger visited us and took off the price of both Hors d\u0026#39;oeuvres for us. \u00a0So that was a very nice gesture, and we do appreciate them recognizing their issues and compensating their clientele.\u003cbr\u003eOh, and Gabby did a great job (only her 5th day there as a waitress at TCF), and was compensated via a nice gratuity (for the full cost of the meal) for putting up with us. \u00a0I also stopped by and thanked the kitchen manager again for his consideration on the free Hors d\u0026#39;oeuvres.\u003cbr\u003eFour Stars for good food, great service, and an always excellent menu."
"Ordered the surf \u0026amp; turf, a drink and a cinnamon roll. The total was $20.97. \u00a0That\u0026#39;s for one person! \u00a0I thought, ok, I guess I\u0026#39;m splurging on a really nice meal. \u00a0I selected a table back in the room with the sports tv, which gave me something to watch while eating. \u00a0When the food came, it was 4 standard sized shrimp, of the variety you can buy a large bag of at Costco for $15, and 4 small pieces of tri-tip. \u00a0 I ordered the \u0026#34;chips\u0026#34; which is french fries for us Yanks. Also a side salad. \u00a0The fries were luke warm. \u00a0The meat was a little gristly, and the ranch dressing was weak and watery. \u00a0I could put up with this in a fast food restaurant if it had cost me $8-10. \u00a0But for $21, I expected more. \u00a0Also, the floor is perpetually slick with meat grease being tracked out of the serving area by the serving staff. \u00a0On the plus side, the $5 cinnamon roll is huge, although this one was lacking in icing for my taste. \u00a0The bbq sauce is pretty tasty. \u00a0I won\u0026#39;t say I won\u0026#39;t go back, but it was not worth the amount charged in my opinion.","I have been very impressed with this Chick-fil-A. The food is always consistent. I really enjoy the Greek yogurt parfait for a healthier breakfast option. The restaurant is ALWAYS spotless and the staff is extremely friendly. I have always felt appreciated and well take care of at this location. Any time I have heard people around me have issues with their orders, the staff goes far beyond what is expected in resolving the issue. Even if it takes refunding the client along with giving them a free meal.",Horrible horrible restaurant. I have never experienced such prejudice. As a visitor from out of town on 04Feb2020 I had to walk out after waiting at my table for 30 minutes for service in a nearly empty restaurant. Servers very well walked past me and when I complained I got a half assed apology. While everyone apparently was enjoying thier time cackling instead of paying attn to guests. I will be calling headquarters to complain and will boycott this restaurant for the rest of my life. So utterly disgusted they donot deserve half a star
The food was amazing all of the ribs were incredible the lemon chicken was great the potatoes were awesome the cucumber salad was incredible the beans were great everything at such a unique flavor and some really wild barbecue sauce is definitely coming back again,We waited in line for the drive thru today for what felt like a while around 5:30 and then we realized that the cashier was talking to one of her friends in the car in front of us and showing off her engagement ring. We were on a time crunch and it was really annoying to see that\u0026#39;s what was holding up the line of six cars behind me.,"Mostly good food and service. However, the manager advised that the owner does not like the restaurant to be well lit...\u0026#34;for ambiance\u0026#34;. \u00a0My party was seated at around 7p and it was so dark that you could not read the menu or see the food. The manager did offer alternate solutions. For example, he brought 2 tea light candles in brown glasses that did absolutely nothing. Also, he suggested we turn on the flashlight feature on our phones and set our water glasses on top to make a sort of make-shift lantern. My nephew did this with his phone and it died before half the meal was over. Basically, the manager and staff at Cheesecake Factory are not allowed to touch the light switches to increase the lighting to acceptable levels for paying customers because the owner likes them barely on."
I have tried this place a few times several times in each location and their food blows. I don\u0026#39;t know why I think it will be different every time I go ?? But it\u0026#39;s just dry bbq. Blahhhhh,We were super bummed. Just went in for breakfast got 3 four piece chick minis in meals and 2 chickfila biscuits in the drive through. We got home and went to feed our daughter the tator tots only to realize they didn\u0026#39;t put them in our bag. Kind of a bummer.

Food was delicious. Restaurant was gross. No utensils. Tons of dirty tables. Sticky floor.,"I LOVE chick fil a. I was looking forward to eating it during my lunch. Here I am, walking towards chick fil a with a happy, excited stomach. I go up and order a grilled chicken sandwich and a large fry, and I asked for chick fil a sauce. Kathy was quiet so I assumed it\u0026#39;s just her personality. So after we finish I asked for chick fil a sauce. Kathy gives me one packet. One little packet. HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO EAT A LARGE FRY WITH ONE PACKET. Also, she didn\u0026#39;t say \u0026#34;my pleasure\u0026#34;.

We always come here since it\u0026#39;s the closest compared to the others for birthdays and special occasions. We enjoy the variety food choices and of course the cheesecakes. However, this past dinning experience has left me thinking if we should continue this tradition any longer. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo start, we got there at 530pm on a Wednesday normal night and still had to wait until 6:10 to be seated. Waited for another 10 mins to even get any service for drink orders. Food came out about 30 mins later which is decent except only for few people in our group. Mind you that food was not delivered by our server so we never got an update of when the other people\u0026#39;s food are coming. We continue to wait another 10 mins but got too hunger and didnt want the food tonget cold. About another 5 mins passed by we finally had to waive over the server to find out when the other foods coming. She checked back with us and turns out they burnt the food and had to remake it. Meanwhile, my order was missing an item that it should come with (avacados) and really not the same without it so I asked her if it should come with this. She said I\u0026#39;ll find out. She came back am told me yes and I said ok (my mistake here cause I assumed she was going to correct this). So I waited and waited but by this time my food is cold and I kinda gave up and lost appetite. Finally the remade food came for my daughter and I asked her if she is planning to give me the avacados, she said she thought I asked if it should come with it and that I didnt want it. Finally everyone (kids) were in melt down mode so I just wanted the check and wanted to ask to remove my order off the check. She came back and said well I got you your avacado. I said my food is cold now anyway. She answered well the avacado goes on top of your food. I was speechless at that point and just asked for the manager. Another 20 mins went by, by this time my wife already took some of the kids to the car already since they wouldn\u0026#39;t have the patients to wait that long... the time is about 7:50 now. Almost 2.5 hrs since we got there. The manager came by and just said we took the order off and didnt really even give me a chance to explain what I am typing in on here. So after everything settle, I left the restaurant at 8pm defeated, exhausted, and hungry... anyway thanks for letting me vent on here. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI know these servers and managers are good people trying to make a living but I am just want to give this feedback so they can better improve their service for what the customers are paying for. The meals are not cheap."
Excellent food! \u00a0Busy place is a good sign of great food...

This place was no different than experiences I\u0026#39;ve had at other locations.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThey have two drive thru lanes which helps speed up drive thru time and are usually very fast with the service.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThey have a playground for kids which is indoors, not incredibly huge, but looks like a great place for kids! Unfortunately I can\u0026#39;t give you any first hand experience considering that I\u0026#39;m not a kid nor do I have any kids. However, I have seen many kids in there having fun! This place is great for families.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe restaurant is very clean inside and has a mixture of booths and tables. They have condiments and straws and napkins (everything except their Chick-fil-A sauces) out on shelves which makes it nice to go grab what you need for your meal. The employees bring your food out to you. Furthermore, as it is Chick-fil-A, they always have friendly service and say \u0026#34;my pleasure\u0026#34; instead of \u0026#34;you\u0026#39;re welcome\u0026#34;! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy favorite menu items are the Chick-fil-A deluxe sandwich with pepper jack cheese or the chicken strips which are also delicious.

We were taking a group out to celebrate a birthday and i spoke to a manager weeks in advance and they said they do not take reservations for more than 6 people. He told me to come at five o clock to put our name down. We did just that only to be told it was a 3.5 hour wait. The manager was not helpful and very dismissive when trying to explain the situation. The food is good, but not waiting-3.5 hours-good. Please figure out your reservation situation. Groups greater than 6 are the people that need reservations. You guys have this backwards. I\u0026#39;m very frustrated with this situation and will be some time before i visit again."
"This is an honest 5 star review. \u00a0The staff warmly greeted us, the food was delivered fast, and really tasty. We were genuinely asked how everything was.

"I am a chef who was raised in the south. So I admit that I am pretty picky when it comes to barbecue. This place would not win any awards in barbecue competition. But if you are looking for some tasty nontraditional barbecue you could definitely do much worse than wallabies. The pulled pork was good, the beans were a little undercooked but not bad. good coleslaw. good pulled chicken, aside from kind of weird honey chipotle sauce. Friendly staff. Fast service. Both Pepsi and Coke on the tap, which I appreciate. Barbecue sauces on the table where pretty good. Everything considered, I would come back and recommend wallabies to friends.","Chick-fil-A EVERY DAY! But seriously, I could come to this location every day.

"My wife and I tried this place last night for the first time. Looking at the menu, the Melbourne burger with chips sounded good to both of us so we ordered two of them to go. I didn\u0026#39;t realize how good pineapple might be on a burger but wow! It was delicious. The meat was cooked well and the overall combination of flavors in the burger were so good. The fry sauce they serve is like a campfire sauce and has a smoky barbecue flavor. I wish the prices were a little better and we\u0026#39;d eat there more but they\u0026#39;re not bad. We\u0026#39;ll definitely go again.",I\u0026#39;ve never been disappointed by Chick-Fil-A. \u00a0This location is like most but less busy in my opinion. \u00a0A few thoughts: They apparently have iced coffee now which is nice. \u00a0Chick-Fil-A sauce is good on anything. \u00a0So is their Polynesian sauce. \u00a0Their Kid\u0026#39;s Meals serving size seems smaller than others but at least you can switch out the toy for a vanilla ice cream cone.,"What has happened to the Murray, Utah Cheesecake Factory? \u00a0The front line people that meet, greet and seat customers need a crash course in manners and need to be taught to be polite. \u00a0There is a true lack of customer service in this restaurant! \u00a0Not too sure we will go back"
"I have been to wallabys several times because I really enjoy their meat and especially their raspberry BBQ sauce, but every time I\u0026#39;m also really dissatisfied by their service. Today they let their silverware run out and They told me it would be 3 minutes before fresh ones came out. Then 5 minutes later they brought out plastic ones, which I am sure they could have brought immediately. Also, it appears they have no designated bus boy because there are always more tables covered in dishes than clean ones we can actually use. Of the 8 booths they have, tonight two were occupied and 6 were covered by trash. After our 20-30 minute dinner someone, our server, finally came out to start cleaning off tables. By that point, there were only about 3 clean tables in the place in the least desirable locations. I also saw no less than 5 people standing in the kitchen just talking, which is inexcusable when the dining area is a disaster. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the past I have also experienced the same. I watched the table le next to me complain to a worker that the sun was in their eyes so the asked that the blinds be dropped (this was at the old location). 40 minutes later the couple left and nothing had been done. The tables are never bussed and items are rarely stocked. It really is quite a shame because the food is quite good, but tonight may have been my last time going here.",I ordered a number one and a sandwich plus a shake and I only got on sandwich.. I didn\u0026#39;t get a receipt. I was mad,"Brunch: Finally got around to having brunch at CF. Was pleasantly surprised. Food portions are huge, as always at CF. Had the Monte Cristo and it was pretty good. Always compare this to the one at Disneyland, but it was decent. Tad to sweet for some reason. So damn full."
"Kinda like an Outback Steakhouse with a quieter family feel. The food was great, I\u0026#39;ve eaten here a few times. I just wish my pulled pork had been a little more warmed up. They had a great 2 for $20 deal going on and we are stuffed! Their new location is welcoming as well.",Great food. They always say \u0026#34;my pleasure\u0026#34; whenever you say \u0026#34;thank you\u0026#34;. I\u0026#39;m always amazed at how well trained and professional the staff is. Most fast food restaurants have turtle-eyed teenagers who don\u0026#39;t care but chick-fil-a has happy well mannered folks.,"Worst customer service I\u0026#39;ve ever experienced here. \u00a0I receive a text that says my order is ready and to come by the front door for pick up. \u00a0The line is around the building which delayed me getting my order for 25 minutes AFTER I received the text that it was ready. If we would have at least received some kind of an apology, a simple \u0026#34;I\u0026#39;m sorry for the inconvenience\u0026#34; would have made the cold food at least bearable."
"We love this place! My favorite meat is the pulled pork with lots of delicious peach BBQ sauce. The mac \u0026amp; cheese is wonderful, as are the baked beans. The highlight of the meal is the plate sized, to die for, cinnamon roll. Warm and gooey. Pure deliciousness!",This is the best fast food place for quality of food and service! Every time I go the service is fast and done with a smile. Everything I have got has been good.,Yet another well run centrally located Cheesecake Factory location. Parking can be rough but isnt that common of Cheesecake factories?! Had the spicy cashew chicken and it was awesome. I loved that the chicken was slightly crunchy. Plenty of cashews and a great flavor. I recommend ordering it with white rice. Their brown bread is just fantastic.
"We love Wallabys. It\u0026#39;s delicious. I like that they have different styles of BBQ sauce to choose from. Honestly it is the best BBQ around here and it\u0026#39;s not overpriced for what you get. Their desserts aren\u0026#39;t that great, so don\u0026#39;t waste your money on those. But the pulled pork is to die for.",My favorite place to go for a chicken sandwich. \u00a0Service is always good. \u00a0Their chick fil a sauce is amazing,"We love The Cheesecake Factory, mainly for their cheesecake,duh. It\u0026#39;s always super busy, and really noisy because it\u0026#39;s always so busy. There\u0026#39;s normally a line to the door. There\u0026#39;s never not a line to be honest. So I highly recommend doing a reservation ahead of time. There was \u00a0one instance where we arrived at our reservation time, only to wait an additional 40 mins to be seated. So what\u0026#39;s the point of a reservation to be honest. We didn\u0026#39;t love our food we ordered. But the appetizers we ordered were delish, along with our cheesecake. I\u0026#39;m giving this 4 Stars because although the atmosphere is noisy and crowded and always busy, you do have the option of coming in to get just a slice of cheesecake to go. Or ordering it online for pickup. Which is what we\u0026#39;ve done a few times to take it home."
We were looking for a place to eat and happen to run across wallabies. I thought the food was good for the price that you pay. I ended up ordering surf and turf and was pretty happy about it. We had two kids with us and the only thing that they really liked was the mac \u0026amp; cheese. I would say this place is more for adults.,"Great location. Really fast and I\u0026#39;m always satisfied with their food. I do wish their salads were a little colder and crunchier, but I\u0026#39;ll try ordering the chicken on the side.","Usually this is a go to spot for dinners with my family.

We let the waiter know about the correction and they said they would fix it. \u003cbr\u003eAbout 10 minutes later, another waiter came and brought my other sister her entree except my other sister ordered fettuccini with chicken and they brought us just fettuccini was with no chicken.\u003cbr\u003eWe waited until another waiter walked by to flag them down and let them know that our order was wrong. The third waiter said he would put in the correction.\u003cbr\u003eWe always say a family prayer and we do not start eating until everyone gets their food.

"Good basic BBQ with a few specialty sauces that are ok. Meat doesn\u0026#39;t have a distinct smoke flavor. Brisket had a very flavorful bark, but it\u0026#39;s shredded so you don\u0026#39;t get much of that bark. Service was fast and friendly. Sides are good and they have some unique offerings. Great for groups with people who aren\u0026#39;t big fans of BBQ or don\u0026#39;t have a taste for smokier styles.",Great fast food. I\u0026#39;m not usually a fan of fast food places but this place is more like a sit down quality with drive thru convenience.,wonderful place for a night out. The food is great and the cheesecakes are marvelous! I would give a 5 but the length of wait always is what knocks it down for me.
"We recently visited this location on Monday, September 7th. This was our first time, and definitely not our last! Amy helped us out a lot.

I don\u0026#39;t even like peppermint, but they do the most PERFECT ratio of peppermint to ice cream. My five stars goes to that. Everything else is pretty good, too.

He proceeded to spend more than five minutes combing through his long hair with his fingers. \u00a0 He also spent a long time scratching his scalp. \u00a0 \u00a0I watched in horror when he went behind the counter to get desserts for customers. \u00a0 He then spent the next couple of minutes again playing with his long hair. \u00a0 If I had not already paid for the food and it was so late I would\u0026#39;ve left. \u00a0 I don\u0026#39;t know if the state of Utah has health laws about keeping your hair tied back, but all of the women had their hair in at least a loose ponytail. \u00a0 Even if it\u0026#39;s not a state of Utah law, it should certainly be a Cheesecake Factory rule."
"The food was good but bad business practice. They only cater to their two for $18 promotion. What happens if you\u0026#39;re an odd number. I had to order my own plate. Te two for 18 gets a dessert, the single plate doesn\u0026#39;t. Kind of stupid. I asked if mine included a dessert they said it didn\u0026#39;t. It made me mad enough where I won\u0026#39;t be coming back.","Very good quality food, and delicious. Also, the employees are always polite, they seem like they really like there job. Will def go again!","You know what you\u0026#39;re getting here and I appreciate that it\u0026#39;s always consistent. We came here for dinner before our show last night, a Friday night. We though getting in before 6pm the wait wouldn\u0026#39;t be too bad. We arrived around 5:20 and it was packed already. Given a buzzer for a 50 minute wait. We hovered near the bar tables to see if anything came up sooner. Around 6pm we found a bar table opening and jumped on it. I personally prefer sitting at their bar tables.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy mom and I shared the Chicken Piccata (subbed the regular chicken for the cheese crusted chicken from the Chicken Romano dish) and my dad ordered the Chicken Madeira (my mom\u0026#39;s favorite dish). Both dishes were large and flavorful. We then shared the lemon raspberry and chocolate turtle cheesecakes. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe reason I\u0026#39;m writing this review though is for our server Tara. She\u0026#39;s was absolutely phenomenal. On top of drinks and service despite how packed the restaurant was. She was a joy to talk to as well. She even help us with paying our bill as we split between gift cards and credit cards. Truly a gem!"
Slow service even after the lunch rush. I went in at 2:07 and didn\u0026#39;t get my food till 2:27. The food was great the wait was not! There was only 2 other people in when I walked in.,I hated chicken nuggets until I discovered Chick Fil-A. Their food is quite delicious. The service is fantastic. And who doesn\u0026#39;t appreciate an establishment with real values?? (Answer: liberals),"I ordered two pieces of cheesecake tonight online. I got the confirmation that said it would be ready by 7:29. I understood that that might be a little off so wasn\u0026#39;t worried when it wasn\u0026#39;t ready when I got there. I then waited 40 minutes at which point I went in to get a refund. I wasn\u0026#39;t upset at this specific location because I thought it was probably more an issue with the ordering system. However, when I went to get my refund the person at the register, who I believe was the manager but I could be wrong, treated me with total apathy and no remorse. All I would have asked for was a little sympathy and I would have been happy with the location. I didn\u0026#39;t get that so I\u0026#39;m frustrated with both this location and the inaccuracy of the ordering system."
"I have always loved wallabys for their smashers, everything else I\u0026#39;ve tried has been good, but nothing too rave worthy. my main problem with this place is the staff. they always seem to be understaffed, and the ones that are there do not give a crap about their job. a little overpriced, but I\u0026#39;ll keep coming here for takeout:)","I like the food here, but my last two visits had problems. \u00a0(I\u0026#39;ve only been to this location about 4 times.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA few weeks ago, I ordered a Deluxe Sandwich and a Grilled Chicken Club Sandwich. \u00a0I received a Grilled Chicken Sandwich (not a club) and a regular Chicken sandwich. \u00a0So they got both of my sandwiches wrong.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTonight, I again ordered a Deluxe Sandwich and a Grilled Chicken Club sandwich. \u00a0I received 2 Deluxe sandwiches. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn both cases, the ticket on the boxes had the correct sandwiches listed, which means the people putting the sandwiches in the boxes don\u0026#39;t know the difference between the various sandwiches. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAdditionally, tonight my meal cost $10.11, and I paid $20.26. \u00a0I only received $10 back, instead of $10.15. \u00a0I don\u0026#39;t care about the 15 cents, or I would have said something. \u00a0But it concerns me the the girl that took my money doesn\u0026#39;t know the difference between a quarter and a dime. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll of these problems lead me to believe that these people either haven\u0026#39;t been properly trained or are simply not qualified for the job.",The Cheesecake Factory has been a Family favorite for many years. Recently we had a \u00a0Family mini reunion and I asked the waitress what my options were for side dish options beyond don\u0026#39;t eat toast or hash browns. She went down the list of some vegetables then she offered me BACCON! A Keto girl\u0026#39;s dream side dish!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you Cheesecake Factory!
"Never been to a Wallabys before. \u00a0I literally was the first customer of the day. \u00a0I say that because the dining room was ok, but some of the tables really weren\u0026#39;t that clean and the floor was clean, but not really clean. \u00a0I ordered the three meat platter with cucumbers and fries. \u00a0The turkey was delicious. \u00a0 The links were unremarkable. \u00a0 The tri-tip was good, but a little tough. \u00a0The cucumber salad had a good flavor, but was not fresh. \u00a0The cucumbers should have been sliced thicker, because when you put them in any kind of a brine or dressing, it doesn\u0026#39;t take them long to get limp and slimy. \u00a0That\u0026#39;s how these were. \u00a0I did not finish them. \u00a0The fries were great, especially with the zesty bbq sauce. \u00a0I probably won\u0026#39;t come back as there are a lot of choices in the Provo/Orem area. \u00a0The wait staff was friendly, polite and efficient. \u00a0Someone did come out and clean those tables while I was eating.","This chick-fil-a is awesome, though I think all of them are. The service is always super fast (almost too fast!) and the food is always great.","We have come here for years. I must say we were more then frustrated! Came on March 12th. \u003cbr\u003eNot only was the restaurant slowest I have ever seen due to a lot of businesses shutting down, but the service was worst we have had anywhere. \u003cbr\u003eDay at host stand for 17minutes waiting to get sat with multiple tables empty. It took more then ten minutes to get waters, ordered our usual right away. Took 26minutes to get bread. Finally got our food, each of us at different times. Mine came out not gluten free (I am celiac, thankfully have been here before to know wat it should look like and I can smell the flour noodles). Sent it back. My bf got a burger supposed to be well done, came out bloody and pink, rare. Sent back, ordered a pizza. Got mine again the exact same. Sent back. A third time after finding two other employees to service us it came out right. By the time We received food it had been over an hour of sitting down. Mind u the restaurant is less then $40% busy. No one in bar area even. \u003cbr\u003eThe only discount on our check was 50% off my noddles. \u00a0 The table four empty table near us also sent two of their plates back to kitchen for not being cooked all the way. It was surprising. And disappointing. Maybe if they had a 2hour wait to sit and eat like they usually do the service might have been better. \u200d \u00a0(restaurants need to be more careful with allergies! It\u0026#39;s not a fad! I would go to emergency room if I had eaten what was served to me even after telling my waitress twice when ordering that\u0026#39;s it\u0026#39;s an allergy)"
"7/25/17: The food tasted great generally and the staff was very friendly but someone accidentally put salt instead of sugar in the whole batch of berry cobbler and they were out of cinnamon rolls. \u00a0The floor was so greasy it was slippery and dangerous. \u00a0They forgot to bring out our veggie sides and butter. \u00a0They cooked the broccoli better this time. \u00a0June 2015: The lady who took our order was very nice and they gave us large samples. \u00a0I could tell as soon as we saw our broccoli it was basically raw, so I asked if they could cook it more, so they took it back a long time and a blonde finally brought it back and put it on the table quickly and I thanked her but she walked off really fast without a response. \u00a0It looked steamed a little more but still tasted and smelled quite raw, so we decided to just take it home and cook it ourselves later. \u00a0Maybe they don\u0026#39;t have a way to steam veggies effectively. \u00a0The baked beans, rolls, honey cinnamon butter, sweet habanero pork, brownie, and their BBQ sauces were yummy. \u00a0Desserts and broccoli size and amount of turkey are huge. \u00a0Brownie was a little cake-like, maybe use less egg.",Place is awesome. So glad they decided to open one up instead of the mall one. I use to get the chicken sandwiches all the time in high school. My coworkers and I go at least twice a week. Great place not to bad on the prices either. Their lemonade is to die for so good and I\u0026#39;m a huge soda fan however not at this place. Come try it out guys,A friend recommended the Sweet Corn Tamale appetizer and it was the best thing I\u0026#39;ve tasted in a long time. The top sauce is great
Neutral,The nicest Chick fil a I\u0026#39;ve ever been to. If you\u0026#39;re looking for a healthy choice go for the Cobb salad with chipotle ranch. It was one of the best tasting salads I\u0026#39;ve ever had.,The cheese cake factory is always good we had a hamburger a steak \u00a0a steak and enchiladas everyone was happy \u003cbr\u003eThen there was the cheese cake It was awesome we all enjoyed a piece of fresh strawberry cheesecake it was excellent
Neutral,"I\u0026#39;ve been a chick-eater for many year now, but I had to come to the new place to find a crunchy chicken. Umm, boy, it was good. My fries were about 10,000 degrees, but since the place was crazy packed I understand the need to cook with plasma.","Never disappointed. Sure this place is always busy and loud, sometimes the service slow but it is \u00a0what it is. We enjoyed their awesome bread as we waited for our entree\u0026#39;s. I love their Bang Bang chicken and shrimp, fish tacos are good too. . Left feeling full and satisfied. Will definitely come back."
Neutral,My entire family is obsessed with Chick-fil-A. I love how kid friendly they are and I can go through their drive through and not unload the kids if they are asleep and the fact that when we do go inside my kids love their playground which is also perfect for rainy days. My husband is the kind who doesn\u0026#39;t like white meat because it\u0026#39;s usually dry but he loves the traditional chick fil a and he keeps saying how amazing and moist their chicken is I love that I\u0026#39;m trying to eat healthier and they have grilled chicken options with the kale side or even a salad and its filling and I don\u0026#39;t feel guilty at all. Their waffle fries are delicious and it\u0026#39;s impossible to just eat one. The customer service is always on point. If that wasn\u0026#39;t enough we tried their breakfast menu today and it was also delicious. I say definitely give them a try. Oh and did I mention how the chicken is real chicken and not some mystery nugget mixture deep fried? Their prices are on the higher end for a fast food restaurant but you can definitely taste the difference.,"We decided to have our Christmas Eve dinner here with my wife daughter and mother. \u00a0I made a reservation through help for 6:15 and was sat around 6:25 it was extremely busy so no issue there. \u00a0We we sat and promptly had our server greet us and get drinks going. We tried to order the sweet and sour cauliflower but they were out so I settled on edamame which was very good and my wife and mother enjoyed the Brussel sprouts. We then ordered mains. \u00a0I had the honey truffle chicken which was perfect very juicy and flavorful. However my side of broccoli was very cold ( the server promptly replaced it with a hot one when I asked ). My wife also had chicken and it to was fantastic. My mother had the shepherds pie and loved it however she did say it\u0026#39;s definitely not a traditional shepherds pie. \u00a0We can\u0026#39;t come into Cheesecake Factory and not have cheesecake so we each ordered a slice to go and enjoyed them at home. \u00a0We ordered the salted caramel, mango key lime, and the chocolate all of which were great. \u00a0Overall I enjoyed it aside from the cold broccoli the service was fantastic. \u00a0I do need to note that it was uncomfortably warm where we were seated and that definitely wasn\u0026#39;t fun. This place is great if you want good food and a standard chain restaurant experience. \u00a0I would come back but definitely on a much quieter evening when it\u0026#39;s not so warm in the seating area."
Neutral,"I love Chick-fil-a, but the Provo location is hands down the best in Utah! \u00a0The service is always good and the food is consistently good.","We were so excited to try for the first time and support them during hard times. We order curbside pickup. We arrived and parked in the designated area. Called about 6 times to let them know we arrived, per the instructions given. No answer. After 20 minutes someone approached us and took our name. They brought our food later on. I checked the bag briefly and it seemed everything was there. My fault for not thoroughly opening every container. There were multiple add-ons that were missing and the food was cold. For what we spent, I was incredibly disappointed. I could\u0026#39;ve got better food elsewhere for half the price."
Neutral,"I don\u0026#39;t \u00a0frequent this location to much. \u00a0I\u0026#39;m more of a buger person. \u00a0But, I have to say these guys make the best chicken soup! \u00a0I look forward to that and it\u0026#39;s what drives me to come back even on a hot summer day. \u00a0This place is always clean when I come here. \u00a0The staff is friendly. \u00a0A little slow at times \u00a0(under staffed?) \u00a0But, the food is always fresh and hot and made to my requests. \u00a0The store on the BYU campus is always good also. \u00a0Not sure if they are owned by the same franchisee. \u00a0I enjoy going there when I go to the book store. EAT MORE CHIKN.","We love the appetizers. \u00a0 We go late in the evening, when there is no wait, and enjoy a late night snack."
Neutral,Neutral,"We had a good time eating at the Cheesecake Factory. The food was quite exceptional. Although it took awhile to be seated, I was surprised how shortly it took for the food to be made and given to us especially for the quality of food ordered. The customer service wasn\u0026#39;t the best, I might add, and it was quite loud in the restaurant as well. I would compare the noise level to a Buffalo Wild Wings or any other kind of sports bar/grill. Overall, it\u0026#39;s a good place to go to for quality food with big serving sizes just be prepared to unload the wallet."
Neutral,Neutral,"Absolutely amazing place, food is fresh and tastes great. So many options to choose from, even gluten free(which my wife greatly appreciated). I would recommend calling for a reservation because it can get busy quick. Great atmosphere and the service is awesome. Food is a bit expensive, but it\u0026#39;s worth it. My family and I would recommend this place to anyone. We will definitely be returning."
Neutral,Neutral,"This is easily one of our favorite places to eat. It\u0026#39;s just fancy enough that it\u0026#39;s a special occasion, but you don\u0026#39;t have to get dressed up to go. It\u0026#39;s always busy, but it\u0026#39;s worth the wait - the food is incredible. We always have great service, and the wait for the food itself is never bad. We love the Chicken Parmesan \u0026#34;Pizza Style\u0026#34;, and there are more than enough options to please anybody, both on the dinner menu and for dessert. Open up a few more locations in Utah already!"
Neutral,Neutral,"They have THEE best chipotle chicken pasta. I could eat it for every meal! The wait staff is kind and efficient. And um \u00a0hi, who could say no to Oreo cheesecake? NO ONE!"
Neutral,Neutral,"We came here yesterday to celebrate a birthday and we were not disappointed. This was my first time sitting down for a meal here and I have to say that I like the ambiance and how professional the waiters are. The food and service was great! Fantastic drinks as well! There was a little bit of a wait for our drink refills, but it was very busy, so I understand. The food came out quickly and the staff was very enthusiastic in helping us celebrate our special occasion! Thank you!"
Neutral,Neutral,"I came here knowing that after I ate, I would have to fast for two days to balance out the calories I consumed. \u00a0 In fact, I did some research while I was waiting for my cheesecake to arrive and I discovered that there are fewer calories in a Macdonald\u0026#39;s quarter pounder with cheese, large fries and 32 oz coke than in lost of the cheesecakes consumed at this place. \u00a0The menu is too big. Way too many choices and just confusing. \u00a0I prefer a few smaller menu. \u00a0I mean, why have a god menu anyway? \u00a0People come here for the cheesecake anyway, so just forget the food menu. \u00a0The prices are high, for what you get. But it\u0026#39;s cheesecake!"
Neutral,Neutral,"Stopped by to grab dessert, why is it so dark, in here?! \u00a0Does the food look that bad?! \u00a0They can have ambience w/turning most of the lights off...have to use my flashlight on my IPhone to read my menu. \u00a0There\u0026#39;s nothing romantic about a dark restaurant, not knowing if that\u0026#39;s what you really ordered.\u003cbr\u003eThank goodness, all I\u0026#39;m having is carrot cake..."

Neutral,Neutral,"Great service, bread, and dessert! We came here for cheesecake. The Godiva cheesecake is over the top and perfect for chocolate lovers. It\u0026#39;s worth every penny. It\u0026#39;s a little expensive but the slice is large enough you can share with 1-3 people."
Neutral,Neutral,"It\u0026#39;s fine. There\u0026#39;s always a wait, the restaurant is loud, and the food is fine. I always feel like I should have gone somewhere else."
Neutral,Neutral,This is just like all other Cheesecake Factory locations. If you are going at normal dinner times expect a long wait which isn\u0026#39;t out of the ordinary. The food was good. Our problem was once we sat it took forever to just get our orders in. Then took quite a while to get the food. Then when we asked for the check that took about 15 minutes. I understand the food taking a while but 15 minutes to print my check was a bit ridiculous. Overall it is a time thing that makes me give this place a lower rating.
Neutral,Neutral,"Amazing service, my waitress specifically was probably the nicest I\u0026#39;ve ever had. Sat quickly. Four Starr\u0026#39;s because the menu is just too big, and the portions were insanely huge. Food tasted great, but I was full with less than half the amount. Overheard the table next to me saying the same things I was thinking at the time. Cheesecakes are as great as ever."
